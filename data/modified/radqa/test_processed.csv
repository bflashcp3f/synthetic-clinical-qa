745971_1_1_O,745971,"FINAL REPORT INDICATION: Abnormal pulmonary function test. Dyspnea with minimal exertion. Clinical suspicion for amiodarone lung toxicity. History of CHF.
Helical and high resolution CT imaging of the chest were performed without IV or oral contrast administration. High resolution CT images were obtained with 1 mm collimation at 2 cm intervals throughout the thorax in both the prone and supine positions. Additionally, three expiratory images were obtained.
Assessment of the lungs reveals diffuse ground-glass opacities and numerous smoothly thickened septal lines. The ground-glass opacities are patchy and diffuse in distribution but most pronounced in the upper lobes. No areas of honeycombing or architectural distortion are identified. Moderate sized dependent bilateral pleural effusions are identified and demonstrate layering on prone images. Adjacent areas of atelectasis in the lung bases show significant improvement with changes in positioning of the patient with minimal atelectatic changes remaining predominantly posteromedially at the bases.
Assessment of the lungs on helical CT acquisition show scattered linear opacities suggestive of discoid atelectasis or scar in the middle lobe and lingula. The ground-glass opacities are again demonstrated on these images. Assessment of the central airways reveals a focal polypoid lesion in the lateral wall of the trachea posteriorly at the level just above the aortic arch, probably due to retained secretions.
Assessment of the soft tissue structures of the thorax reveals several lymph nodes in the mediastinum in the prevascular and paratracheal regions. The largest lymph node is in the lower right paratracheal region, measures approximately 11 mm in short axis dimension, and has a prominent fatty center. No significant hilar lymph node enlargement is observed on this non-contrast study. The heart is upper limits of normal in size. Coronary artery calcifications are noted. No pericardial effusion is evident.
Imaging of the upper portion of the abdomen demonstrates no significant abnormality within the imaged portion of the liver or spleen, but these organs are incompletely imaged on this study. The spleen appears somewhat prominent but size cannot be determined as it is not completely imaged on this study. There is a focal well-circumscribed low density lesion in the right adrenal gland suggestive of adenoma. There is also focal thickening of the left adrenal gland. The imaged portion of the pancreas is unremarkable.
Vascular calcifications are observed in the aorta and in the abdominal aortic branches.

Adjacent areas of atelectasis in the lung bases show significant improvement with changes in positioning of the patient with minimal atelectatic changes remaining predominantly posteromedially at the bases.
Assessment of the lungs on helical CT acquisition show scattered linear opacities suggestive of discoid atelectasis or scar in the middle lobe and lingula. The ground-glass opacities are again demonstrated on these images. Assessment of the central airways reveals a focal polypoid lesion in the lateral wall of the trachea posteriorly at the level just above the aortic arch, probably due to retained secretions.
Assessment of the soft tissue structures of the thorax reveals several lymph nodes in the mediastinum in the prevascular and paratracheal regions. The largest lymph node is in the lower right paratracheal region, measures approximately 11 mm in short axis dimension, and has a prominent fatty center. No significant hilar lymph node enlargement is observed on this non-contrast study. The heart is upper limits of normal in size. Coronary artery calcifications are noted. No pericardial effusion is evident.
Imaging of the upper portion of the abdomen demonstrates no significant abnormality within the imaged portion of the liver or spleen, but these organs are incompletely imaged on this study. The spleen appears somewhat prominent but size cannot be determined as it is not completely imaged on this study. There is a focal well-circumscribed low density lesion in the right adrenal gland suggestive of adenoma. There is also focal thickening of the left adrenal gland. The imaged portion of the pancreas is unremarkable.
Vascular calcifications are observed in the aorta and in the abdominal aortic branches.
The osseous structures of the thorax demonstrate degenerative changes in the spine and evidence of previous sternotomy procedure. Finally, note is made of bilateral calcified pleural plaques.",Was amidarone identfiied within the scans?,"{'text': [], 'answer_start': []}"

PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 6365**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 109**], the attending radiologist, who was present and supervising throughout the procedure. As no suitable superficial veins were identified, ultrasound examination of the left upper extremity was performed, revealing the left brachial vein to be patent and compressible. The area was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was achieved with subcutaneous injection of 3 cc of 1% lidocaine. Under real time ultrasound guidance, the left brachial vein was accessed using a 21 gauge micropuncture needle. Hard copy pre- and post-puncture images were obtained with ultrasound. A 0.018 guidewire was then advanced through the needle and into the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Based on the markers on the guidewire, the PICC was trimmed to a length of 42 cm. The needle was then exchanged for an introducer sheath. The PICC was then advanced over the wire through the sheath. The peel-away sheath and wire were then removed. The catheter was then aspirated, flushed, capped, and heplocked. The line was then secured with a Statlock device and a sterile transparent dressing applied.
