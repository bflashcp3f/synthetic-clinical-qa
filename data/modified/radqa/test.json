On gradient echo images there is a large area of\n intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right parietal lobe and left thalamus\n which following administration of gadolinium reveals ring-enhancing lesions.\n These are suspicious for hemorrhagic metastases given the patient's history.\n Additional ring-enhancing lesions throughout the supra- and infratentorial\n compartments are visualized.  There is a moderate amount of peritumoral edema\n involving the right parietal lobe lesion in addition to a second right\n parietal lesion along the falx high in the vertex.  The other areas of\n metastases reveal a minimal amount of peritumoral edema.", "document_id": "853499_O"}
