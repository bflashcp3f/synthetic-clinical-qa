No destructive lytic or blastic lesions are seen in the\n osseous structures of the torso.\n\n ABDOMEN CT W/WO CONTRAST:  On series 3, image 14, there is a 2 mm low\n attenuation lesion in the posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe which is\n too small to characterize.  No other focal liver lesions are seen.  There is\n no intra or extrahepatic ductal dilatation.  No abnormality is seen in the\n gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenals, or kidneys.  The kidneys show\n symmetric nephrograms and excretion.  The visualized ureters have normal\n diameter.\n\n A large constricting circumferential mass is present in the antrum of the\n stomach, measuring approximately 7 to 10 cm in length and at least 15 mm thick\n in some portions of the wall.  The body and fundus of the stomach are markedly\n dilated, filled with food mixed with oral contrast.  There is no extravasation\n of oral contrast.  Multiple enlarged lymph nodes are present in the\n gastrohepatic ligament, the largest of which are 1 cm in the short axis.\n\n PELVIS CT W/CONTRAST:  There is no free intraperitoneal fluid.  The visualized\n loops of small and large bowel are normal.  The patient is s/p aortobifemoral\n graft.  Tiny aneurysms are present at both anastomoses of the grafts with the\n common femoral arteries.  A left renal artery stent is present.  There is no\n retroperitoneal, pelvic, or inguinal adenopathy.  A small fat-containing\n hernia is present in the left inguinal canal.\n\n No abnormality is seen in the bladder.  The prostate is markedly enlarged and\n shows heterogeneous enhancement.",

There is mild LV enlargement on the stress images compared\n with the resting images.\n\n Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after\n Persantine administration shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of\n approximately 45%.

The region of hemorrhage is seen on the\n diffusion-weighted sequences. No other focal areas of restricted diffusion are\n present. On the T2-weighted sequences, there are several focal rounded areas\n of decreased signal intensity, which are possibly suspicious for vascular\n structures in the region of the hemorrhage, but there is no flow-related\n enhancement in these areas to suggest a vascular anomaly. The hemorrhage\n causes mass effect and impresses the 4th ventricle but the 4th ventricle is\n not completely effaced. At this time, there is no hydrocephalus. No areas of\n abnormal enhancement are seen throughout the brain to suggest a mass or tumor.\n There are focal and confluent areas of T2 signal hyperintensity in the\n periventricular white matter consistent with chronic microvascular infarction.",

    "context": "FINAL REPORT\n PHYSICIANS: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 36229**], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 34429**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 29846**] [**Doctor Last Name **],\n who were both present and supervising the entire procedure.\n\n INDICATIONS: This patient is a 79-year-old male with an asymptomatic 7-cm\n abdominal aortic aneurysm noted incidentally on a CT scan for a small bowel\n obstruction. He presents for aortogram with evaluation for possible endograft\n repair.\n\n MEDICATIONS AND CONTRAST: The patient received no IV sedation during the\n procedure, however was continuously hemodynamically monitored throughout the\n case. 8 cc of 1% lidocaine were used as local anesthesia and a total of 240 cc\n of Optiray 60% contrast was used throughout the case.\n\n TECHNIQUE: After consent was obtained, patient was placed in the supine\n position on the fluoroscopy table and the right groin was shaved, prepped, and\n draped in the usual sterile manner. Common femoral artery was identified with\n the aid of fluoroscopic guidance using bony landmarks. 8 cc of 1% lidocaine\n local anesthesia were infiltrated at the site of the right common femoral\n artery and a 19-gauge single wall puncture needle was introduced into the\n right common femoral artery after a small skin [**Doctor Last Name **] was made with an #11 blade\n and 0.035\" Bentson guidewire was then advanced through the needle and into the\n lower abdominal aorta. A 5-French sheath was then placed over the wire and its\n side arm was flushed throughout the case with heparinized saline. Over the\n wire, a 5-French marked Omniflush catheter was inserted to the level of L1 and\n abdominal aortogram was performed including AP and lateral views. The catheter\n tip was then withdrawn to the level of the lower abdominal aorta and right and\n left anterior oblique views of the pelvic arteriogram were performed.\n Subsequently, a bilateral femoral arteriogram was performed. The catheter was\n removed. The sheath was removed and adequate hemostasis was achieved with\n manual pressure at the puncture site. The patient tolerated the procedure\n well. No immediate complications were noted.\n\n FINDINGS: The celiac trunk is patent, although mild stenosis of the proximal\n celiac trunk is noted on the lateral view of the aorta. Patent single\n bilateral renal arteries are noted with the left renal artery being lower than\n the right. Distance from the lower renal artery to the aortic bifurcation is\n 13 cm. The distance from the aortic bifurcation to the right iliac bifurcation\n is 8 cm.  There is about a 40 degree lateral angulation of the infrarenal\n aorta.  In the lateral view, there is mild posterior angulation of the\n infrarenal aorta.   The right iliac system is more tortuous than the left.\n Bilateral common internal and external iliac arteries are patent. The femoral\n arteries are also widely patent, as are the superficial femoral and profunda\n femoris arteries. Bilateral superficial femoral arteries have diffuse mild\n disease.",

There are no intravascular\n filling defects with pulmonary arterial branches to suggest PE.  A non-\n specific density is visualized within the main pulmonary artery, of unclear\n etiology.  The central airways are patent.\n\n CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The patient is S/P cholecystectomy.  The common\n duct is dilated to 12 mm, possibly due to ampullary stenosis; however, a\n retained stone cannot definitively be excluded.  Pneumobilia is likely related\n to a previous sphincterotomy.  There are no focal hepatic lesions. The liver,\n spleen, adrenals and pancreas are normal in appearance.  The kidneys enhance\n promptly and symmetrically with sub-cm bilateral low attenuation lesions which\n are too small to characterize.  There is no hydronephrosis.  Small\n retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen.  There is no ascites.  The bowel is\n unremarkable.\n\n CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  A Foley catheter is in place.  Evaluation of the\n pelvis is limited secondary to streak artifact from a right hip prosthesis.  A\n left common iliac artery stent is in place.  The patient has had previous\n bypass surgery in the left groin region with post-operative changes.\n\n Evaluation of the osseous structures demonstrates degenerative changes.",

There is no pneumothorax.\n\n There is continued right middle lobe atelectasis which appears slightly\n worsened in the interval.

There\n are increased interstitial markings, unchanged.\n\n No pleural effusions are seen.",
