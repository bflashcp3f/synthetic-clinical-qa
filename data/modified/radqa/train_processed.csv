______________________________________________________________________________
FINAL REPORT HISTORY: 84-year-old male with chest and shoulder pain.
COMPARISON: No prior study available.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the chest without IV contrast followed by axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after Optiray IV contrast with multiplanar reformats.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: High-density material consistent with hemorrhage is present throughout the middle mediastinum insinuating between the great vessels and circumferentially around the aortic arch. A discrete collection of blood layers anterior to the pericardium and superior to the heart, consistent with an anterior mediastinal hematoma, measuring approximately 7.0 x 4.0 x 11.0 cm. A small amount of high- density fluid is also present within the pericardium consistent with hemopericardium.
The ascending aorta is dilated up to 5.0 cm. There are extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch with wall irregularity at this level (series 400b, image 35) consistent with penetrating ulcers and likely the source for aortic leak given the circumferential hematoma around the arch. There is no evidence of aortic pseudoaneurysm, dissection, or transection, and no active extravasation is seen at this time. The great vessels are patent. The pulmonary arterial tree opacifies well. The left vertebral artery originates directly off the aortic arch between the left common carotid and subclavian arteries, an anatomic variant. The trachea and airways to the segmental level are patent. There is no evidence of ventricular aneurysm or rupture.
Evaluation of the lungs demonstrates moderate background emphysematous changes. There is mild biapical scarring. There is a small amount of left pleural fluid which measures 30HU, indicating a small hemothorax. Dependent atelectasis is mild. There are small areas of smooth pleural thickening of the lateral pleura of the right upper and middle lobes, (series 3, image 35). There is no pneumothorax.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A small subcentimeter hypodense focus of the right hepatic lobe is too small to characterize. The gallbladder, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The pancreatic duct is top normal in caliber. No obstructing stones are seen. There is a diverting colostomy in the left lower quadrant. There is herniation of a small amount of intraperitoneal fat through the abdominal wall ostomy defect. There are bilateral simple renal cysts, the larger is exophytic on the left measuring 9.4 cm in diameter. There is no free gas or fluid within the abdomen.
There is heavy arthrosclerotic change of the abdominal aorta, which is tortuous and ectatic. Proximal to the aortic bifurcation, the aorta measures up to a caliber of 3.2 cm. The iliac arteries also show heavy atherosclerotic change. The origins of the celiac axis, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 257**] are calcified; however, these vessels and their major branches appear patent.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Numerous brachytherapy seeds are present within the prostate gland, which is enlarged. The urinary bladder is distended with contrast. There is a right inguinal hernia with protrusion of a small portion of small bowel, but no evidence of incarceration or obstruction. There is no free pelvic fluid. There are numerous sigmoid diverticula, but no evidence of acute diverticulitis.

Aortic root dilated to 5.0cm. Extensive athero change of aorta but no definite source of hematoma identified. No evidence of aortic transection or dissection. no ventricular rupture or aneursym seen.
______________________________________________________________________________
FINAL REPORT HISTORY: 84-year-old male with chest and shoulder pain.
COMPARISON: No prior study available.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the chest without IV contrast followed by axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after Optiray IV contrast with multiplanar reformats.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: High-density material consistent with hemorrhage is present throughout the middle mediastinum insinuating between the great vessels and circumferentially around the aortic arch. A discrete collection of blood layers anterior to the pericardium and superior to the heart, consistent with an anterior mediastinal hematoma, measuring approximately 7.0 x 4.0 x 11.0 cm. A small amount of high- density fluid is also present within the pericardium consistent with hemopericardium.
The ascending aorta is dilated up to 5.0 cm. There are extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch with wall irregularity at this level (series 400b, image 35) consistent with penetrating ulcers and likely the source for aortic leak given the circumferential hematoma around the arch. There is no evidence of aortic pseudoaneurysm, dissection, or transection, and no active extravasation is seen at this time. The great vessels are patent. The pulmonary arterial tree opacifies well. The left vertebral artery originates directly off the aortic arch between the left common carotid and subclavian arteries, an anatomic variant. The trachea and airways to the segmental level are patent. There is no evidence of ventricular aneurysm or rupture.
Evaluation of the lungs demonstrates moderate background emphysematous changes. There is mild biapical scarring. There is a small amount of left pleural fluid which measures 30HU, indicating a small hemothorax. Dependent atelectasis is mild. There are small areas of smooth pleural thickening of the lateral pleura of the right upper and middle lobes, (series 3, image 35). There is no pneumothorax.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A small subcentimeter hypodense focus of the right hepatic lobe is too small to characterize. The gallbladder, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The pancreatic duct is top normal in caliber. No obstructing stones are seen. There is a diverting colostomy in the left lower quadrant. There is herniation of a small amount of intraperitoneal fat through the abdominal wall ostomy defect. There are bilateral simple renal cysts, the larger is exophytic on the left measuring 9.4 cm in diameter. There is no free gas or fluid within the abdomen.
There is heavy arthrosclerotic change of the abdominal aorta, which is tortuous and ectatic. Proximal to the aortic bifurcation, the aorta measures up to a caliber of 3.2 cm. The iliac arteries also show heavy atherosclerotic change. The origins of the celiac axis, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 257**] are calcified; however, these vessels and their major branches appear patent.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Numerous brachytherapy seeds are present within the prostate gland, which is enlarged. The urinary bladder is distended with contrast. There is a right inguinal hernia with protrusion of a small portion of small bowel, but no evidence of incarceration or obstruction. There is no free pelvic fluid. There are numerous sigmoid diverticula, but no evidence of acute diverticulitis.

FINAL REPORT INDICATION: 78-year-old man status post fall, please assess for acute process.
TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the head were obtained without administration of intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats were acquired.
COMPARISON: Outside hospital CT from [**2200-11-20**].
FINDINGS:
Compared to the prior outside hospital CT, there is new acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage extending from the superior right pons cranially into the right-sided mid brain and right thalamus, measuring about 3 cm(CC) x 1 cm (TRV) x 2 (AP) cm (Series 2, image 12 and series 401B, image 27). There is mild effacement of the third ventricle from mass effect from the right thalamic hemorrhage.
Compared to the outside hospital CT, there is interval increase of acute bifrontal (left greater than right) subarachnoid hemorrhage (on the left: series 2, image 17 and on the right: series 400B, image 25).
Compared to the outside hospital CT, there is unchanged acute vertex right parafalcine subdural hematoma at the(series 2, image 24), unchanged subdural hematoma layering over the (left greater than right) tentorium cerebelli, unchanged intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the posterior left temporal lobe (series 2, image 9) and unchanged hemorrhage in the lateral cerebellopontine cistern between the left flocculus and the tentorium (series 2, image 8) cerebelli. Possible small amount of hemorrhage in the right perimesencephalic cistern. The previously seen hemorrhage in the fourth ventricle has decreased. There is a thin layer of acute extra-axial hemorrhage overlying the left parietal lobe (series 2, image 18), unchanged from the outside hospital.
There is a nondisplaced left frontal skull fracture associated with overlying subgaleal hematoma.

There is mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells and the right greater than left maxillary sinus. The mastoid air cells and remainder of the paranasal sinuses are clear and well aerated.",Are there any skull fractures?,"{'text': ['nondisplaced left frontal skull fracture'], 'answer_start': [2317]}"

ANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine.
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the procedure and risks involved to the patient. The right upper arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.
Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound images obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over the guide wire. There was difficulty in advancing the micropuncture wire through the right subclavian vein. A venogram was performed using 20 cc of Optiray 60%. The venogram demonstrates marked narrowing of the right subclavian vein with extensive venous collateralization.

COMPARISON: No relevant comparisons available.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic outlet to the pubic symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness with oral contrast. No IV contrast was administered per request of the clinical team as patient was going to receive nephrotoxic chemotherapy medications. Coronal and sagittal reformats were obtained for evaluation.
CT CHEST: No nodules are seen in the unenhanced thyroid gland. The thoracic aorta and pulmonary artery is of normal caliber. Numerous axillary lymph nodes are identified, ranging up to 1.5 x 2.0 cm in the right axilla (2:18) and 2.7 x 2.3 cm in the left axilla (2:12). Other larger axillary lymph nodes have a normal fatty hilum, e.g. a 1.6 x 6.0cm node in the right axilla (300b:35). Multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes are not enlarged by size criteria. Evaluation for hilar lymphadenopathy is limited without IV contrast, but there is no gross contour abnormality to suggest enlarged lymph nodes. The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within normal limits aside from mild atherosclerotic calcifications in the LAD. A trace pericardial effusion is within physiological range. There is no pleural effusion.
Lung window images demonstrate no worrisome nodule, mass, or consolidation. There is mild dependent bibasilar atelectasis. Airways are patent to the subsegmental levels bilaterally.
CT ABDOMEN: Evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs and for lymphadenopathy is limited without intravenous contrast. A 1.3-cm hypodensity at the hepatic dome (2:43) is too small to characterize. The remainder of the unenhanced liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder is normal. The spleen is enlarged, measuring 26.1 cm craniocaudally. Small calcifications within the spleen suggest prior exposure to granulomatous disease. A 1.5cm splenic hyperdensity (2:74) is nonspecific and may represent a small hemangioma. The pancreas and bilateral adrenal glands are normal. There is no hydronephrosis, renal stone or contour-altering renal mass.
The small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber without obstruction. The appendix is visualized and is normal (2:89). There is no free fluid and no free air. The aorta is of normal caliber throughout with mild atherosclerotic calcifications.
There is bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. For example, a right caval node measures 2.0 x 4.9 cm (2:81). A left paraaortic node measures 3.0 x 2.6cm (2:79). There is a region of mesenteric stranding surrounding numerous small lymph nodes measuring up to 1.0cm (2:79, 87), which may be due to obstruction of lymphatic channels.

1237499_2_1_O,1237499,"FINAL REPORT CLINICAL HISTORY: 66-year-old woman with new diagnosis of CLL. Evaluate for lymphadenopathy.
COMPARISON: No relevant comparisons available.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic outlet to the pubic symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness with oral contrast. No IV contrast was administered per request of the clinical team as patient was going to receive nephrotoxic chemotherapy medications. Coronal and sagittal reformats were obtained for evaluation.
CT CHEST: No nodules are seen in the unenhanced thyroid gland. The thoracic aorta and pulmonary artery is of normal caliber. Numerous axillary lymph nodes are identified, ranging up to 1.5 x 2.0 cm in the right axilla (2:18) and 2.7 x 2.3 cm in the left axilla (2:12). Other larger axillary lymph nodes have a normal fatty hilum, e.g. a 1.6 x 6.0cm node in the right axilla (300b:35). Multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes are not enlarged by size criteria. Evaluation for hilar lymphadenopathy is limited without IV contrast, but there is no gross contour abnormality to suggest enlarged lymph nodes. The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within normal limits aside from mild atherosclerotic calcifications in the LAD. A trace pericardial effusion is within physiological range. There is no pleural effusion.
Lung window images demonstrate no worrisome nodule, mass, or consolidation. There is mild dependent bibasilar atelectasis. Airways are patent to the subsegmental levels bilaterally.
CT ABDOMEN: Evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs and for lymphadenopathy is limited without intravenous contrast. A 1.3-cm hypodensity at the hepatic dome (2:43) is too small to characterize. The remainder of the unenhanced liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder is normal. The spleen is enlarged, measuring 26.1 cm craniocaudally. Small calcifications within the spleen suggest prior exposure to granulomatous disease. A 1.5cm splenic hyperdensity (2:74) is nonspecific and may represent a small hemangioma. The pancreas and bilateral adrenal glands are normal. There is no hydronephrosis, renal stone or contour-altering renal mass.
The small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber without obstruction. The appendix is visualized and is normal (2:89). There is no free fluid and no free air. The aorta is of normal caliber throughout with mild atherosclerotic calcifications.
There is bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. For example, a right caval node measures 2.0 x 4.9 cm (2:81). A left paraaortic node measures 3.0 x 2.6cm (2:79). There is a region of mesenteric stranding surrounding numerous small lymph nodes measuring up to 1.0cm (2:79, 87), which may be due to obstruction of lymphatic channels. A subcutaneous nodule in the left flank measures 1.0 x 1.0 cm (2:64).

FINAL REPORT INDICATION: Chest pain radiating to the back.
COMPARISON: None.
TECHNIQUE: Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the level of the aortic arch to the aortic bifurcation before and after the administration of 150 cc of IV Optiray. Nonionic contrast was used secondary to rapid bolus requirement needed per protocol. Multiplanar reconstructions were performed.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: Mural calcifications are present within the aortic arch. There is no evidence of aortic dissection, aneurysmal dilatation, or intramural hematoma within the thoracic aorta. Coronary artery calcifications and coronary artery stents are present. The heart, pericardium and great vessels are otherwise unremarkable. Moderate- sized bilateral pleural effusions are present, right greater than left. There are multiple prominent lymph nodes within the mediastinum, primarily within the tracheal and prevascular regions. The largest lymph node is within the prevascular space and measures 9 mm in greatest short axis diameter. No significant hilar or axillary lymph adenopathy is identified.
Lung window images reveal bibasilar compressive atelectasis. No pulmonary nodules are identified. The airways are patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The abdominal aorta is within normal limits without evidence of dissection, aneurysmal dilatation, or intramural hematoma. Mural calcifications are present within the abdominal aorta which extend into the iliacs bilaterally. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, right kidney, ureters, stomach, and loops of small bowel appear unremarkable. Small hypodensities within the upper and mid pole of the left kidney are present, most simple cysts. Both kidneys enhance symetrically. The proximal ureters appear within normal limits. There is no free air or free fluid. No significant mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph adenopathy is present. Retained contrast appears to be present in several diverticula within the descending and sigmoid colon. Otherwise, the large bowel appears unremarkable. No free fluid is identified.

FINAL REPORT CT ANGIOGRAPHY
HISTORY: Status post fall, on Coumadin, with facial injuries including fracture into the carotid canal. Evaluate the carotid arteries.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast imaging of the head.
FINDINGS: Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length. The hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci. As was mentioned in the facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to have mildly evolved since the prior study. These, as well cause mild cerebral sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or overt change in ventricular size appreciated. At this time, there is also subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures. A tiny amount of possible pneumocephalus is seen in relationship to the falx cerebri. This finding was not seen on the prior study.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE UPPER NECK AND HEAD, EXTENDING FROM THE LEVEL OF THE HYOID BONE AS FAR CEPHALAD AS THE VERTEX OF THE SKULL: Multiplanar reconstructions as well as volumetric offline processed images were created.
FINDINGS: There is no definite sign of compromise of the lumen of the internal carotid artery through either carotid canal. The more distal internal carotid arteries are patent. There are moderate left and milder right atherosclerotic calcifications involving the supraclinoid portions of the internal carotid arteries. The vertebrobasilar arterial system appears patent. Using the vascular lumen as an index, no definite signs of a dissection are noted, although in this regard, fat saturated MR imaging is more sensitive in detecting an intramural hematoma.

FINAL REPORT CT ANGIOGRAPHY
HISTORY: Status post fall, on Coumadin, with facial injuries including fracture into the carotid canal. Evaluate the carotid arteries.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast imaging of the head.
FINDINGS: Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length. The hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci. As was mentioned in the facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to have mildly evolved since the prior study. These, as well cause mild cerebral sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or overt change in ventricular size appreciated. At this time, there is also subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures. A tiny amount of possible pneumocephalus is seen in relationship to the falx cerebri. This finding was not seen on the prior study.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE UPPER NECK AND HEAD, EXTENDING FROM THE LEVEL OF THE HYOID BONE AS FAR CEPHALAD AS THE VERTEX OF THE SKULL: Multiplanar reconstructions as well as volumetric offline processed images were created.
FINDINGS: There is no definite sign of compromise of the lumen of the internal carotid artery through either carotid canal. The more distal internal carotid arteries are patent. There are moderate left and milder right atherosclerotic calcifications involving the supraclinoid portions of the internal carotid arteries. The vertebrobasilar arterial system appears patent.

* = Mildly abnormal, ** =moderately abnormal, *** = severely abnormal CMR Technical Information: 1) Structure: Axial dual-inversion T1-weighted images of the myocardium were obtained without spectral fat saturation pre-pulses. 2) Function: Breath-hold cine Steady-state free precession (SSFP) images were acquired in the left ventricular 2-chamber, 4-chamber, horizontal long axis, contiguous short axis orientations, sagittal and coronal orientations of the left ventricular outflow tract, and aortic valve short axis orientations. 3) Flow: Phase-contrast cine images were obtained transverse to the aorta (axial plane) and main pulmonary artery (oblique plane). 4) Perfusion/Viability: Delayed enhancement (DE) images were obtained using a segmented inversion-recovery TFE acquisition, short-axis, four chamber and two-chamber long-axis images were obtained 15 minutes after injection of a total of 0.2 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine (29 Magnevist solution).

Findings: The images were acquired while the patient was in sinus rhythm.
Structure and Function There was normal epicardial fat distribution without evidence of myocardial fatty infiltration. The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal intensity. The pericardium appeared normal in thickness. There was a small (< 1.0 cm), circumferential pericardial effusion. There were bilateral pleural effusions. The origins of the left main and right coronary arteries were identified in their customary positions. The diameters of the ascending aorta, descending aorta, and main pulmonary artery were normal. The left atrial AP dimension was mildly increased. The left atrial dimensions in the 4-chamber view was mildly increased. The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was mildly enlarged. The left ventricular end-diastolic volume index was moderately elevated. The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction was severely depressed at 29%, with severe regional and global systolic function. There was severe global hypokinesis/akinesis with relative sparing of the basal and mid portions of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The left ventricular mass was normal. The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index was normal. The calculated right ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 51%, with normal regional and global systolic function. The aortic valve was trileaflet with normal valve area.
Quantitative Flow There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt. Aortic flow demonstrated no significant aortic regurgitation. There was no significant mitral regurgitation. The right ventricular stroke volume and pulmonic flow demonstrated mild pulmonic and tricuspid regurgitation.
Viability There was hyperenhancement of the basal anterior septum, the mid and distal portions of the inferoseptal, anteroseptal, anterior, and anterolateral segments, and the apex.

Findings: The images were acquired while the patient was in sinus rhythm.
Structure and Function There was normal epicardial fat distribution without evidence of myocardial fatty infiltration. The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal intensity. The pericardium appeared normal in thickness. There was a small (< 1.0 cm), circumferential pericardial effusion. There were bilateral pleural effusions. The origins of the left main and right coronary arteries were identified in their customary positions. The diameters of the ascending aorta, descending aorta, and main pulmonary artery were normal. The left atrial AP dimension was mildly increased. The left atrial dimensions in the 4-chamber view was mildly increased. The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was mildly enlarged. The left ventricular end-diastolic volume index was moderately elevated. The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction was severely depressed at 29%, with severe regional and global systolic function. There was severe global hypokinesis/akinesis with relative sparing of the basal and mid portions of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The left ventricular mass was normal. The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index was normal. The calculated right ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 51%, with normal regional and global systolic function. The aortic valve was trileaflet with normal valve area.
Quantitative Flow There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt. Aortic flow demonstrated no significant aortic regurgitation. There was no significant mitral regurgitation. The right ventricular stroke volume and pulmonic flow demonstrated mild pulmonic and tricuspid regurgitation.
Viability There was hyperenhancement of the basal anterior septum, the mid and distal portions of the inferoseptal, anteroseptal, anterior, and anterolateral segments, and the apex.

The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced centrally. As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip positioned centrally.
CLINICIANS: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the attending radiologist, reviewed the study.
ANESHTESIA: Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the procedure and risks involved to the patient. The left upper arm including the existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.
Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla. Attempts to either aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were unsuccessful. A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla. At this stage, a small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating the catheter to be extravascular. Therefore, the catheter was removed. A new access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access. A 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla. Therefore, a small amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the level of axilla. A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC. A 5 French Kumpe catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC line wire. The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally. The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings were applied. Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.",How is the picc line placed?,"{'text': ['A new access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.

1139854_1_1_O,1139854,"FINAL REPORT MEDICAL HISTORY: 70-year-old man with thyroid and esophageal cancer needing chemotherapy. The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced centrally. As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip positioned centrally.
CLINICIANS: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the attending radiologist, reviewed the study.
ANESHTESIA: Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the procedure and risks involved to the patient. The left upper arm including the existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.
Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla. Attempts to either aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were unsuccessful. A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla. At this stage, a small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating the catheter to be extravascular. Therefore, the catheter was removed. A new access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access. A 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla. Therefore, a small amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the level of axilla. A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC. A 5 French Kumpe catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC line wire. The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.

______________________________________________________________________________
FINAL REPORT HISTORY: 35-year-old man with history of recent IVDU, presented with abrupt onset of chills on [**2134-4-15**].
TECHNIQUE: CT torso with oral and IV contrast with coronal and sagittal reformats. Please note that no peripheral IV line was available and contrast was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).
COMPARISON: Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].
FINDINGS:
CT CHEST: The airways are patent up to subsegmental level. There are bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot exclude aspiration. There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting. There is no pleural effusion or pericardial effusion. There is moderate cardiomegaly. There is increased number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria. There is slightly prominent lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be reactive.
CT ABDOMEN: Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast bolus is suboptimal. With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal size. There is a possible fatty liver. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation. The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding. There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction. The appendix is normal (2:115). There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.
CT PELVIS: There is moderate amount of stool in the rectum and sigmoid. The urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and focus of air, presumably from recent instrumentation, however, correlate with symptoms. The prostate and seminal vesicles are normal. There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis (2:126-127). The visualized loops of small bowel and pelvis appear normal. There is a right femoral line.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is focus of air and contrast in the left hip from recent intervention.
SOFT TISSUE: No evidence of subcutaneous free air in the imaged portion of the soft tissue. Please note that part of the soft tissue of the right pelvis was not imaged due to patient body habitus.",Do we have any free fluid in the pelvis?,"{'text': ['small amount of free fluid'], 'answer_start': [2615]}"

TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images were obtained throughout the lumbar spine after intrathecal injection of contrast from a myelogram. Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were provided. The images were reviewed using soft tissue and bone window algorithms.
FINDINGS:
The normal lordotic curvature of the lumbar spine is maintained. There is minimal dextroscoliosis of the lumbar spine. There is grade I retrolisthesis of L3 over L4 and of L5 over S1 vertebra. There is grade I anterolisthesis of L4 over L5 vertebra.
The vertebral bodies are normal in height. Schmorl's nodes are noted along the inferior endplates of L1 and L4 vertebral bodies.
There is decreased L3-L4 to L5-S1 intervertebral discs height.
The distribution of the contrast surrounding the conus medullaris appears normal and the conus terminates at the level of L1-L2 level.
At T11-T12, there is posterior disc bulge indenting the ventral thecal sac.
At T12-L1, there is no neural foraminal or spinal canal stenosis.
At L1-L2 and L2-L3, there is no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.
At L3-L4, there is posterior disc bulge with superimposed central protrusion which along with posterior endplate osteophytes and facet arthropathy causes moderate spinal canal stenosis and crowding of nerve roots of cauda equina. The disc with end plate and facet osteophytes causes moderate bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.
At L4-L5, there is posterior disc bulge which along with ligamentum flavum thickening and facet arthropathy causes moderate spinal canal stenosis. The disc with end plate and facet osteophytes causes severe right and moderate left neural foraminal stenosis.
At L5-S1, there is disc bulge asymmetric to the left indenting ventral thecal sac and possibly indenting the traversing right S1 nerve root. The disc with end plate and facet osteophytes causes mild right and severe left neural foraminal stenosis.

COMPARISON: Outside CT abdomen dated [**2195-7-15**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images were obtained throughout the lumbar spine after intrathecal injection of contrast from a myelogram. Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were provided. The images were reviewed using soft tissue and bone window algorithms.
FINDINGS:
The normal lordotic curvature of the lumbar spine is maintained. There is minimal dextroscoliosis of the lumbar spine. There is grade I retrolisthesis of L3 over L4 and of L5 over S1 vertebra. There is grade I anterolisthesis of L4 over L5 vertebra.
The vertebral bodies are normal in height. Schmorl's nodes are noted along the inferior endplates of L1 and L4 vertebral bodies.
There is decreased L3-L4 to L5-S1 intervertebral discs height.
The distribution of the contrast surrounding the conus medullaris appears normal and the conus terminates at the level of L1-L2 level.
At T11-T12, there is posterior disc bulge indenting the ventral thecal sac.
At T12-L1, there is no neural foraminal or spinal canal stenosis.
At L1-L2 and L2-L3, there is no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.
At L3-L4, there is posterior disc bulge with superimposed central protrusion which along with posterior endplate osteophytes and facet arthropathy causes moderate spinal canal stenosis and crowding of nerve roots of cauda equina. The disc with end plate and facet osteophytes causes moderate bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.
At L4-L5, there is posterior disc bulge which along with ligamentum flavum thickening and facet arthropathy causes moderate spinal canal stenosis. The disc with end plate and facet osteophytes causes severe right and moderate left neural foraminal stenosis.
At L5-S1, there is disc bulge asymmetric to the left indenting ventral thecal sac and possibly indenting the traversing right S1 nerve root. The disc with end plate and facet osteophytes causes mild right and severe left neural foraminal stenosis.

RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA: 20.3 mCi F-18 FDG ([**2121-6-6**]); INDICATION: Large right thyroid mass, FNA cytology demonstrating squamous cells, with worsening dysphagia.
METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.] A series of overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 96 mg/dL. The area imaged spanned the region from the orbits to the thighs.
Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake. The determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important implications regarding the significance of that uptake.
INTERPRETATION:
HEAD/NECK: A large, lobulated mass with hetergeneous solid and cystic components arises from the right thyroid lobe and extends into the superior neck at the level of the mandible. This lesion measures 7.3 cm TV x 5.2 cm AP x 8.2 cm CC, with SUVmax of 24.13. There is severe mass effect on and compression of the trachea and esophagus.
No FDG-avid intracranial lesions are seen in the imaged skull base.
CHEST: A long-segment region of circumferential wall thickening up to 1.5 cm is present in the mid-to-distal esophagus, with SUVmax of 35.12. This abnormality spans a craniocaudal distance of approximately 9.4 cm, from the level of the carina to just above the gastroesophageal junction.
An upper right paratracheal node measures 1.4 cm, with SUVmax of 17.45. 3-mm pulmonary nodule in the anterior right upper lobe is non-FDG-avid. Thoracic aortic and three-vessel coronary artery calcifications are present.
ABDOMEN/PELVIS: No FDG-avid lesions are seen in the abdomen and pelvis. Dense calcifications are present in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 86-year-old male with a subarachnoid hemorrhage along the Sylvian fissures bilaterally and small intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital horns bilaterally.
TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient's family after explaining the risks, indications and alternative management. Risks explained included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent, with possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.
The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions. Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire was introduced and the needle taken out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 units of heparin in 1000 cc of saline).
The following blood vessels were selectively catherized, and arteriograms were performed from these locations: left common carotid artery, left internal carotid artery, left subclavian artery, left vertebral artery.
LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY: No significant atherosclerotic disease noted.
LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: There is good opacification of the left proximal and distal left internal carotid artery, anterior and middle cerebral artery branches. There is a small aneurysm measuring approximately 2.5 mm in diameter with a wide neck and appears to arise at the origin of the posterior communicating artery.
LEFT VERTBRAL ARTERY: There is minimal narrowing noted at the origin of the left vertebral artery. There is good opacification of the proximal and distal left vertebral artery, basilar artery and posterior cerebral arteries on both sides.

FINAL REPORT HISTORY: 43-year-old woman, with ovarian cancer, with extensive intra-abdominal involvement. Now pain, fever and white count elevation. Assess for interval change.
COMPARISON: Multiple CT abdomen and pelvis with latest on [**2193-8-29**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis after only administration of oral contrast. No IV contrast was administered secondary to patient's acute renal failure. Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained for evaluation.
CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY: The visualized lung bases are clear without pleural effusions. The absence of IV contrast significantly limits evaluation of intra-abdominal organs. The liver is noted with a geographic hypodensity in segment V, incompletely assessed, but grossly unchanged compared to the study 7 days ago. There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The gallbladder is noted with small amount of hyperdense material layering in the dependent portion, compatible with gallstone. There is no CT evidence of acute cholecystitis. The adrenal glands, pancreas and spleen is grossly unremarkable. The splenic vein is markedly calcified.
Bilateral hydroureteronephrosis is moderate-to-severe but relatively unchanged in severity compared to prior. The stomach, duodenum and proximal loops of small bowel are grossly unremarkable. There is free oral contrast passage through and reaching up to the mid descending colon. There is no free air or air in the intra-abdominal cavity.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is marked interval increase and spread of subcutaneous air along the left posterolateral pelvic wall, compatible with interval aggressive necrosis of the underlying soft tissues. Hyperdense material is noted among the necrosis, most conspicuous in images 2:62-64, concerning for extraluminal oral contrast from fistulization of the adjacent bowel. Scattered pockets of tiny free air along the adjacent bowel loop, also suggestive of microperforation. There is no definite bowel obstruction. Colostomy is again noted in the left lower quadrant. The large collection of soft tissue and fluid is again noted in the mid pelvis, amorphous and difficult to assess the boundary. The asymmetrically enlarged left psoas muscle, incompletely evaluated without IV contrast, either represent an intramuscular mass or abscess.

FINAL REPORT HISTORY: 53-year-old man with HIV, hep C, substance abuse who presents with fever and mental status changes.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were obtained with oral contrast. No IV contrast was administered due to patient's allergy. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
CT CHEST: Coronary and aortic calcifications are identified. The heart size is normal. There is prominent axillary and mediastinal adenopathy. There are bilateral nodular and consolidative opacities, most prominently involving the lower lobes in a dependent fashion. Small opacities and consolidation were also noted in the right middle lobe. There are no pleural or pericardial effusions. A nasogastric tube is coiled within the mid esophagus.
CT ABDOMEN: Within the limits of this study without contrast, the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, and bowel loops are within normal limits. There is no free air or free fluid. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified. There does appear to be some mesenteric stranding however the evaluation is quite limited by the lack of abdominal fat.
CT PELVIS: Foley catheter and air are noted in the bladder. There are prostatic and vascular calcifications. The sigmoid colon and rectum are unremarkable. The appendix is normal. There is no free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

Now, he suffers from multiple medical problems and pontine infarctions which have essentially left him near ""locked-in"". On [**1-6**], the patient underwent MRA which suggested long segmental areas of narrowing in the basilar. The patient has not tolerated long-term conservative therapy and angioplasty/stenting is considered. The patient and his family participated in a family meeting when all options were discussed extensively with the patient and family on Friday of last week and the treatment is now attempted this Monday ([**2109-2-11**]).
PROCEDURE: The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure are explained to the patient and his children. They understand and sign the consent form.
The patient is brought to the neurointerventional suite and placed under general anesthesia. A Swan-Ganz catheter is placed via left subclavian approach, radial A line is present.
The groin is prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Using standard Seldinger technique a 6 French Arrow sheath was placed in the groin. Arteriogram was performed through the dilator and demonstrates an extremely tortuous iliac and femoral system. Ultimately, a sheath exchange is performed over an exchange length 038 microwire for a 25 cm 6 French bright tip sheath. Utilizing a combination of 5 French Berenstein, 5 French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 2, 5 French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 3 in conjunction with long tapered Terumo glidewire and standard Terumo glidewire the following vessels are selected:
The 5 French Berenstein catheter is used to select the right common carotid artery. The carotid bifurcation is studied in AP and lateral projections utilizing road map technique. There is no significant stenosis. The catheter is placed in the internal carotid artery and the camera centered over the head. Arteriographic assessment in the AP and lateral planes demonstrates filling of the posterior cerebral territory, predominantly via leptomeningeal collaterals to the posterior cerebral. There is extensive intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Venous drainage is predominantly to the right side.
Next, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1408**] 3 catheter is used to select the left common carotid artery. Examination is performed over the head via hand injection utilizing AP and lateral films. Again, seen are areas of atherosclerotic narrowing. There is a large posterior communicator with direct supply to the posterior cerebral on this left side.
Next, the 5 French Berenstein catheter is put into the base of the left vertebral artery. This is studied in the neck in AP and lateral positions. Then, the camera was centered in the brain and studied in AP and lateral positions. The left vertebral is an extremely tortuous vessel with a complete 360 degree turn in its base. The anterior spinal access is a large access arising from this artery with prominent spinal drainage seen on this examination. There is no filling of the basilar on this injection. The distal vertebral flows into the posterior inferior cerebellar. The posterior inferior cerebellar supplies anastomosis to the superior cerebellar artery.
Next, the 5 French Berenstein was placed into the right subclavian. Injection and examination of the right subclavian was done with the blood pressure cuff placed on the right arm. The right vertebral is a small vessel that appears to terminate in a small PICA. The basilar was not filled. As the caliber of the vertebral was smaller than the catheter being utilized, it was decided to not enter the vertebral.
The examination is discussed extensively with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37273**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15994**] of Stroke Neurology. After extensive discussion, the decision is made to stop at this point.

Utilizing a combination of 5 French Berenstein, 5 French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 2, 5 French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 3 in conjunction with long tapered Terumo glidewire and standard Terumo glidewire the following vessels are selected:
The 5 French Berenstein catheter is used to select the right common carotid artery. The carotid bifurcation is studied in AP and lateral projections utilizing road map technique. There is no significant stenosis. The catheter is placed in the internal carotid artery and the camera centered over the head. Arteriographic assessment in the AP and lateral planes demonstrates filling of the posterior cerebral territory, predominantly via leptomeningeal collaterals to the posterior cerebral. There is extensive intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Venous drainage is predominantly to the right side.
Next, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1408**] 3 catheter is used to select the left common carotid artery. Examination is performed over the head via hand injection utilizing AP and lateral films. Again, seen are areas of atherosclerotic narrowing. There is a large posterior communicator with direct supply to the posterior cerebral on this left side.
Next, the 5 French Berenstein catheter is put into the base of the left vertebral artery. This is studied in the neck in AP and lateral positions. Then, the camera was centered in the brain and studied in AP and lateral positions. The left vertebral is an extremely tortuous vessel with a complete 360 degree turn in its base. The anterior spinal access is a large access arising from this artery with prominent spinal drainage seen on this examination. There is no filling of the basilar on this injection. The distal vertebral flows into the posterior inferior cerebellar. The posterior inferior cerebellar supplies anastomosis to the superior cerebellar artery.
Next, the 5 French Berenstein was placed into the right subclavian. Injection and examination of the right subclavian was done with the blood pressure cuff placed on the right arm. The right vertebral is a small vessel that appears to terminate in a small PICA. The basilar was not filled. As the caliber of the vertebral was smaller than the catheter being utilized, it was decided to not enter the vertebral.
The examination is discussed extensively with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37273**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15994**] of Stroke Neurology. After extensive discussion, the decision is made to stop at this point.
The long sheath is changed for a short 6 French sheath. The heparin is D/C. The sheath will be pulled with the aid of a Syvek patch in the PACU.",How is the blood flow in basilar artery?,"{'text': ['no filling of the basilar'], 'answer_start': [3117]}"

Her abdomen was shielded and the neck and indwelling right pheresis catheter were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A pre-procedural timeout and huddle were performed per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol. Under ultrasound guidance with hard copy images on file, a micropuncture set was used to access the left internal jugular vein and a 0.018 wire was advanced into the SVC. This was subsequently exchanged for a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire. A 12 French x 16 cm pheresis catheter with VIP was selected and after sequential fascial dilatation, the catheter was placed over the wire with the tip positioned in the distal SVC. The catheter was secured to the skin with 0 silk suture. The catheter was flushed and aspirated well. A final fluoroscopic spot image demonstrated good position of the catheter and no pneumothorax.

FINAL REPORT IMPRESSION:
1. Soft tissue attenuation noted within the soft tissues of the right neck extending from the level of the hyoid bone inferiorly to the superior mediastinum as described above. Nonvisualization of the inferior right internal jugular vein, which reconstitutes at the level just superior to the hyoid bone. Adjacent focal area of hypoattenuation may represent thrombosed jugular vein vs cystic lymph nodes. Color doppler US is may be obtained for further characterization.
2. Tracheal stent noted originating in the subglottic airway, extending to the superior mediastinum with secretions noted inferior to the stent.
3. Right vocal cord paralysis, with or without tumor involvement. Correlation with direct visualization is recommended.
4. Linear air-filled structure extending to the right of midline, originating from the esophagus, possibly representing an esophageal diverticulum.
5. Lytic lesions in vertebral bodies C2 and C3, present on prior PET without abnormal FDG uptake. While these findings may be attributed to degenerative change, a bone scan may be obtained for further characterization.

COMPARISON: MRI dated [**2121-5-15**], PET/CT [**2121-6-6**].
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous helical acquisition through the neck was performed with intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittally reformatted images were created.
FINDINGS: There is diffuse increased soft tissue attenuation within the soft tissues of the right neck, located posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle, encircling the right carotid artery, which is patent. The right inferior jugular vein is not visualized, likely secondary to thrombosis. There is reconstitution of the superior aspect of the internal jugular vein at the level of the superior hyoid bone, from the right branches of the external jugular vein. Also noted is a moderate sized hypodense area deep to the sternocleidomastoid, which may represent either the thrombosed internal jugular vein versus a necrotic lymph node. The abnormal area of soft tissue attenuation within the right neck extends inferiorly into the superior mediastinum surrounding the innominate artery and abutting the right aspect of the left common carotid and subclavian arteries, all of which are patent. It also extends around the trachea. No focal enhancement is noted. A stent is identified within the trachea extending from the subglottic airway to the superior mediastinum. Secretions are noted within the trachea below the level of the stent. The esophagus is patulous in appearance and appears to have a large diverticulum extending to the right of midline (2:80). Normal appearing thyroid gland is noted on the right. On the left, the superior aspect of the thyroid is identified.
There is medialization of the right vocal cord, causing narrowing of the airway at this level. Also noted is enlargement of the right ventricle, consistent with right vocal cord paralysis. The abnormal soft tissue attenuation extends to the region of the right vocal cord, and tumor invasion cannot be excluded.
The osseous structures are intact. Multilevel degenerative changes noted throughout the cervical spine with partial fusion of vertebral body C5 and C6. Well-circumscribed lytic lesions are noted within the C3, C4, vertebral bodies. seen on prior PET/CT without evidence of abnormal FDG uptake.

Bilateral emphysematous changes are again noted. The degree of atelectasis in the lower lobes is improved along with the decrease in pleural effusions. No definite pulmonary nodules or masses are identified. Pleural thickening along the right lateral chest wall is unchanged from multiple studies.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable. The gallbladder is non-distended. Borderline pancreatic ductal dilation (3.5 mm) is unchanged. No masses are identified in the pancreas. Bilateral renal cysts up to 9.2 cm in diameter are unchanged. Marked atheromatous calcification of the abdominal aorta is consistent with atherosclerotic disease. Three areas of focal dilation of the infrarenal aorta proximal to the aortic bifurcation, measure up to 3.1 cm and are unchanged from the earliest study. Again noted is high-grade narrowing at the origins of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. Single renal arteries bilaterally are patent although there is narrowing at the ostium of the left renal artery.

FINDINGS: There is persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle with a significant nondependent meniscus which may indicate a loculated effusion or chronic scarring. No free air is detected in the abdomen. Scattered air-fluid levels are noted. Overall, there is a gentle paucity of bowel gas. The air-fluid levels noted are most likely colonic.

FINAL REPORT CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2197-4-24**].
HISTORY: 80-year-old man status post fall, taking Coumadin; evaluate for fracture.
TECHNIQUE: Helical 2.5 mm DCT axial sections were obtained from the skull base through the upper T3 level, sagittal and coronal reformations were prepared, and all images are viewed in bone, soft tissue and lung window on the workstation.
FINDINGS: There are no comparisons on record. For detailed description of the extensive facial, sinus and temporal bone fractures, please see separate report of concurrent head CT. There are ET and NG tubes in situ ""tamponading"" the prevertebral soft tissues, and limiting their evaluation. However, no gross prevertebral soft tissue hematoma is identified. The cervical alignment is, overall, intact and the normal lordosis is maintained, with only minimal retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 and C5 on C6, likely related to disc and facet joint degenerative disease. The atlantoaxial and atlanto-occipital alignment is maintained and no skull fracture is demonstrated to involve the skull base, itself. No acute cervical spine fracture is identified. There are multilevel degenerative changes, most prominent at the anterior atlantoaxial articulation, as well as the C5-6 and C6-7 levels, where there are relatively [**Name2 (NI) 2336**] disc-spondylotic ridges, which do not significantly narrow the ventral spinal canal. There is moderate right neuroforaminal narrowing at C5-6 and more mild right neuroforaminal narrowing at the C6-7 levels, but no other significant neuroforaminal narrowing is seen.
There is no abnormal air within the cervical soft tissues, and the cervical airway appears grossly intact with ET tube in place. Noted are relatively symmetric dependent opacities at both lung apices, representing either atelectasis or contusion; these are better characterized on the concurrent CT torso.

CT scan suggested focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site. Evaluate for extent of small bowel inflammation or other pathology.
COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen oral contrast and 1 mg of intramuscular glucagon was also administered.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and evaluated on the workstation.
FINDINGS: Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.

FINDINGS: Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging. There is equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement (200:68). However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation or edema.
Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted, with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion, the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.
The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable. The large bowel is normal in appearance without wall thickening or distention. There is no fluid collection to suggest abscess formation. Small scattered mesenteric nodes are not pathologically enlarged.
The visualized liver is normal in appearance. There is no biliary ductal dilatation. The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are normal. The major mesenteric vessels are widely patent. The bladder is normal in appearance. The visualized marrow signal is normal.

TECHNIQUE: Axial T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images were obtained.
FINDINGS: The residual left occipital hematoma shown on the [**2114-9-11**] CT is again visualized. The T2 hyperintense blood breakdown products measure approximately 7 cm in anterior/posterior dimension. The residual intraventricular hemorrhage is also visible layering in the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 383**]. There are multiple areas of parenchymal hemosiderin, as seen on the MRI [**2114-8-1**] and there is right frontal encephalomalacia. That MRI preceded the hematoma but there are multiple intervening CT's. Compared to the CT of two days previously, there is no change in the mass effect on the left lateral ventricle, the left parietal and occipital sulci or in the shift of the septum pellucidum towards the right.
TECHNIQUE: A 3D time-of-flight study was derived from overlapping axial slabs through the inferior cranium.
FINDINGS: The intradural portions of the right vertebral artery are poorly seen. This study is somewhat limited by patient motion. There is focalization of the left vertebral artery and a focal stenosis cannot be excluded, although there is good distal flow. The basilar artery and the distal internal carotid arteries are widely patent. The major branches of the cerebral arteries appear normal.
TECHNIQUE: A venous 2D time-of-flight study was derived from a coronal slab.
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the technically superior study of [**8-1**]. There is chronic partial occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus. Flow is seen in the internal cerebral veins. The straight sinus is enlarged, best seen on the source images. There may be minimal recanalization of the left transverse sinus. There are large right transverse and sigmoid sinuses.

SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:
For pharmacologic coronary vasodilatation 0.4 mg of regadenoson (0.08 mg/ml) was infused intravenously over 20 seconds followed by a saline flush. She had no anginal symptoms or ischemic ECG changes.
IMAGING METHOD:
Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi. Tracer was injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
Following resting images and following intravenous infusion, approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi was administered intravenously. Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes following tracer injection.
Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.
INTERPRETATION:
The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and breast attenuation. There is activity adjacent to the heart in the rest images.
Left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a reversible, mild reduction in photon counts involving the basal inferior wall. The defect improves with attenuation correction. The reversibility appears artifactual due to adjacent activity.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axially acquired images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the symphysis with oral and IV contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
IV CONTRAST: 130 cc Optiray 350.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is a small hypoattenuating nodule within the right lobe of the thyroid, which is unchanged in appearance. A tracheostomy tube is again noted, unchanged in position. There is vague stranding within the mediastinal fat surrounding the tracheostomy tube, however, no focal fluid collection is detected. There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque within the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta including the left subclavian artery.
The major airways are patent down to the subsegmental level bilaterally. There is again noted to be a large left pleural effusion and stable complete left lower lobe collapse. There may be a loculated component of the left effusion and a complex effusion cannot be entirely excluded. A previously noted small right pleural effusion has increased to a moderate- size. There is an increased amount of passive atelectasis from the larger right pleural effusion in the right lower lobe. In the visualized lung parenchyma, no acute infectious process is suspected.
There is dense three- vessel coronary artery calcification and no appreciable pericardial effusion is detected. A mitral valve replacement is again noted, unchanged in position.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, and pancreas are all unremarkable. New small calcification in the gallbladder suggests interval development of small stones. There is stable focal thickening of the left adrenal gland. In the upper pole of the right kidney, there is an exophytic hypoattenuating lesion which is stable in appearance, most consistent with a simple cyst. The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable. There is no hydronephrosis.
A gastrostomy tube is again noted well seated within the stomach without evidence of abnormality. No free fluid or free air is identified within the abdomen. There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque throughout the abdominal aorta and iliac branches.

FINAL REPORT HISTORY: 43-year-old female with ovarian cancer and colostomy, now with nausea, vomiting, and chills.
STUDY: Non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis; coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also generated.
COMPARISON: [**2193-4-30**].
FINDINGS: The visualized portion of the heart and lungs appear unremarkable.
In this limited non-contrast study, again is seen in segment V of the liver an area of hypodensity measuring approximately 1.6 x 1.6 cm. The liver shows no evidence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Within the gallbladder, there is dense layering material most consistent with sludge. The spleen is normal in size and appearance. The pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable. Both kidneys demonstrate marked hydronephrosis that appears unchanged from previous study. Contrast is noted throughout the small bowel and most of the proximal colon that does not quite reach the ostomy. Within the opacified region of bowel loops, no evidence of obstruction is seen. No free air or free fluid is seen.
PELVIS: The previously described left pelvis mass appears increased in size compared to previous study, although given lack of IV contrast is ill-defined in. It continues to appear intimately associated with the neighboring loop of bowel. Additionally, oral contrast is seen in the vagina suggesting enterovaginal fistula. A few small locules of gas are seen near the staple line of the Hartmann's pouch; it is unclear if intra- or extra-luminal. The ostomy does not show any surrounding fluid collections.

TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast per fast bolus protocol. Thin section and multiplanar reformations were obtained through the chest.
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are unremarkable. Specifically, the thoracic aorta is well opacified and upon review of axial and multiplanar reformation images there is no evidence of aortic tear, dissection, or transection. There is however a moderate hematoma adjacent to the aorta. There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy. There are no pleural effusions. Bilateral chest tubes are noted, the right extending toward the posterior diaphragm and the left extending superiorly to the apex before descending along the mediastinum to the approximate level of the aortic arch. A moderate pneumothorax is noted inferiorly on the left. In addition, a small amount of air is tracking along the peripheral portion of the left chest tube.

FINAL REPORT CT SCAN OF THE FACIAL BONES
HISTORY: Status post fall. On Coumadin. Evaluate for fracture or retrobulbar hematoma.
TECHNIQUE: Axial non-contrast imaging of the facial bones with sagittal and coronal reconstructions.
COMPARISON STUDY: CT scan of the head, dated [**2197-4-24**] reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1009**] as revealing numerous facial and skull fractures- see his extensive report for complete description of the findings.
FINDINGS:
The massively comminuted skull fracture is not completely depicted on this study as a number of its components lie at the vertex of the calvarium. The principal right frontal fracture appears unchanged in its configuration as does the extensively comminuted nasal bone fractures. There is an extensive fracture involving the sphenoid sinus septum, with rotation of the fracture fragment present. There is a probable additional fracture involving the basisphenoid, principally to the right of midline. The right orbital roof fracture is well depicted on the coronal images as a ""blowout"" type. At this time, there is no definite sign of either right orbital emphysema or pneumocephalus, aside from a tiny focus of gas near the superior portion of the falx cerebri. Nevertheless, the fact that these more extensive gas collections seen on the previous scan does raise the concern for communication between the orbit and sinuses with the intracranial region. There is a crescent-shaped of soft tissue density immediately subjacent to the right orbital roof, consistent with an orbital hematocyst. The maximum thickness of this abnormality is 6 mm. Transversely, it extends from approximately the level of the superior oblique muscle to the area of the lacrimal gland. There is no proptosis. There is a mild degree of right and more moderate left-sided periorbital soft tissue swelling noted, particularly on the medial side adjoining the nose. There is partial imaging of the petrous temporal bones, and confirmation of the suspected complex fracture of this bone on the left side, including the ossicular dislocation involving the incus. There is bilateral presumed hemotympanum and considerable opacification of the mastoid sinuses, along with marked degrees of opacification of both maxillary sinuses, likely with hemorrhagic contents. The sphenoid sinus is essentially totally opacified and there are bilateral air-fluid levels and substantial opacification of both ethmoid sinuses. Moderate mucosal thickening and a probable air-fluid level is noted within the frontal sinus. While the present study is not optimized for brain tissue detail, there is probably evidence for right frontal subarachnoid blood, but no epidural hematoma. Over the 24 hours between scans, there is development of what appear to be bilateral subdural hygromas, somewhat more prominent on the patient's left side.",Do we see any mandibular fractures?,"{'text': [], 'answer_start': []}"

______________________________________________________________________________
FINAL REPORT CT SCAN OF THE FACIAL BONES
HISTORY: Status post fall. On Coumadin. Evaluate for fracture or retrobulbar hematoma.
TECHNIQUE: Axial non-contrast imaging of the facial bones with sagittal and coronal reconstructions.
COMPARISON STUDY: CT scan of the head, dated [**2197-4-24**] reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1009**] as revealing numerous facial and skull fractures- see his extensive report for complete description of the findings.
FINDINGS:
The massively comminuted skull fracture is not completely depicted on this study as a number of its components lie at the vertex of the calvarium. The principal right frontal fracture appears unchanged in its configuration as does the extensively comminuted nasal bone fractures. There is an extensive fracture involving the sphenoid sinus septum, with rotation of the fracture fragment present. There is a probable additional fracture involving the basisphenoid, principally to the right of midline. The right orbital roof fracture is well depicted on the coronal images as a ""blowout"" type. At this time, there is no definite sign of either right orbital emphysema or pneumocephalus, aside from a tiny focus of gas near the superior portion of the falx cerebri. Nevertheless, the fact that these more extensive gas collections seen on the previous scan does raise the concern for communication between the orbit and sinuses with the intracranial region. There is a crescent-shaped of soft tissue density immediately subjacent to the right orbital roof, consistent with an orbital hematocyst. The maximum thickness of this abnormality is 6 mm. Transversely, it extends from approximately the level of the superior oblique muscle to the area of the lacrimal gland. There is no proptosis. There is a mild degree of right and more moderate left-sided periorbital soft tissue swelling noted, particularly on the medial side adjoining the nose. There is partial imaging of the petrous temporal bones, and confirmation of the suspected complex fracture of this bone on the left side, including the ossicular dislocation involving the incus. There is bilateral presumed hemotympanum and considerable opacification of the mastoid sinuses, along with marked degrees of opacification of both maxillary sinuses, likely with hemorrhagic contents. The sphenoid sinus is essentially totally opacified and there are bilateral air-fluid levels and substantial opacification of both ethmoid sinuses. Moderate mucosal thickening and a probable air-fluid level is noted within the frontal sinus. While the present study is not optimized for brain tissue detail, there is probably evidence for right frontal subarachnoid blood, but no epidural hematoma.

Technical Information: After a timing bolus acquisition, retrospectively cardiac gated contrast enhanced 64-slice coronary CTA was performed. 3D images were obtained and reviewed. CT-cine images were reviewed to assess left ventricular systolic function. Metoprolol and nitroglycerin were given prior to image acquisition.

Findings: Structure and Function The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal intensity without evidence of abnormal perfusion. The pericardial thickness was normal. The diameters of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter was normal. The left atrial AP dimension was mildly increased. The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was moderately increased. The end-diastolic volume was moderately increased. The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 65% with normal regional systolic function. The anteroseptal and inferolateral wall thicknesses were normal. The left ventricular mass was normal.
Coronary Imaging 	CT coronary angiography revealed an anomalous origin of a dominant right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. The right coronary artery was increased in size but not aneurismal. The origin and orientation of the left main coronary artery was normal. The left main was increased in size but not aneurismal. The left main trifurcated into the LAD, LCx and ramus intermedius without evidence of disease. The LAD was increased in size but not aneurismal, with large septal branches and multiple bridging collaterals to the right coronary artery. The LAD had 1 diagonal branch and was free of disease. The LCx had 1 OM branch and was free of disease. The calcium score was 0.

FINAL REPORT INDICATION: Status post MVA, car vs tree.
No prior CT scans are available for comparison.
TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were aquired helically from the lung apices through the pubic symphysis with 150 cc of Optiray conrast. There were no adverse reactions to contrast administration.
FINDINGS:
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of traumatic aortic injury. The aorta is of normal caliber and demonstrates no surrounding hematoma or active extravasation. The heart and great vessels are unremarkable. No pleural or pericardial effusions are seen. Minimal dependent changes are seen within the lung bases. No pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar or mediastinal nodes are seen. No pneumothorax is present.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver enhances symmetrically without evidence of surrounding hematoma or laceration. The spleen is normal. Pancreas and duodenum are unremarkable without evidence for traumatic injury. Both kidneys enhance symmetrically without perinephric fluid or laceration. The gallbladder, adrenal glands, and intraabdominal loops of small bowel are unremarkable. No mesenteric fluid collection is seen. The celiac, superior, and inferior mesenteric arteries are unremarkable. The SMV, splenic and portal veins are all patent. There is no ascites or free intraabdominal air.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Distal ureters, bladder, and sigmoid colon are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis. Adjacent to the rectum is a dense oval calcific density which measures 13 mm in greatest dimension. This finding is of unknown etiology, but given the calcification, it is likely a chronic finding.

REASON FOR EXAM: Evaluate for interstitial lung disease, patient with pulmonary hypertension.
Comparison is made with prior chest x-rays dated [**6-29**] through [**2176-7-3**].
TECHNIQUE: High-resolution CT through the chest was performed without IV contrast. Images were acquired in end inspiration and expiration prone and supine position. 5, 1.25-mm collimation images and coronal reformations were reviewed.
FINDINGS: The airways are patent to the subsegmental levels. Multifocal areas of ground-glass opacity in the upper lobes are greater in the right side. The size of the pulmonary arteries that goes towards the area of ground-glass opacities have the same caliber as the ones going to the non-affected lung. Subpleural interstitial abnormality in the left upper lobe has the appearance of post-radiation changes.
A tiny calcified granuloma is in the right upper lobe (series 104A, 71). A 2-mm nodule in the right upper lobe (5, 25) is not calcified. Tiny calcified granuloma is in the left lower lobe (5, 30). There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. Cardiac size is normal. Moderate calcifications are in the left circumflex, LAD, main left coronary, and right main coronary artery. Mild calcification is in the aortic annulus. There is no mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy. The main pulmonary arteries are mildly enlarged. The right main pulmonary artery measures 30.5 mm.
Healing fracture is in the lateral aspect of sixth left rib. Irregularity in the distal aspect of the right scapula could represent an old healed fracture or a prominent nutrient foramen. There are no bone findings of malignancy.

COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis [**2193-5-22**].
CLINICAL INFORMATION: 43-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer, on home hospice, with new left lower back growth and pain.
TECHNIQUE: Axial images were acquired of the abdomen and pelvis following the administration of oral contrast only.
FINDINGS:
LUNG BASES: The lung bases are clear, the heart is normal in size.
ABDOMEN: A hypodensity is again seen within segment V of the liver, increased in size compared with prior, now measuring 3.2 cm in its longest axis. There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The gallbladder demonstrates dense layering material consistent with sludge. The spleen appears normal. The pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The distal esophagus, stomach, and duodenum contain contrast, and are otherwise normal in appearance. There is no intraperitoneal free air. Loops of small bowel are opacified by contrast, and appear to fistulize with a large soft tissue mass with central cavitary portion containing a gas-contrast/fluid level, as seen on the prior exam (3; 66). The kidneys bilaterally demonstrate hydronephrosis, and hydroureter, unchanged from prior study.

959075_1_1_O,959075,"FINAL REPORT CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2197-4-24**].
HISTORY: 80-year-old man, status post fall, taking Coumadin; evaluate for bleed.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 5 mm axial tomographic sections were obtained from the skull base to the vertex and viewed in brain, bone, and lung window on the workstation.
FINDINGS: There are no comparison studies on record. There is a severe acute soft tissue injury with large right frontal and left parietovertex soft tissue swelling, subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous emphysema. This is associated with an extensive, circumferential oblique- coronal skull fracture which traverses the right frontal and left temporal bones, as well as the sphenoid bone and clivus, described in more detail below. The right frontal fracture is associated with a focal lentiform extra- axial hematoma measuring roughly 8 mm in thickness and 3.5 cm in maximal transverse dimension. This demonstrates a relatively low-attenuation portion, anteriorly, which may represent acute, non-clotted blood. This collection may be bounded by the coronal suture, and therefore lie in the epidural space. There is moderate subarachnoid hemorrhage occupying the immediately subjacent sulci, which are slightly flattened, due to the mass effect of the hematoma. No definite adjacent parenchymal contusion is seen, and there is no associated shift of the midline structures or mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral ventricle. There is no evidence of subfalcine, uncal or downward transtentorial herniation. No significant extra-axial hematoma is identified at the corresponding left frontotemporal fracture site, though there is subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci in this region, and there may be a small parenchymal contusion, at the level of the left sylvian fissure.
There is extensive left supra- and periorbital soft tissue edema and hemorrhage, which does not appear to violate the orbital cone, and the retrobulbar fat in both orbits, as well as the periorbita, is preserved, though there is a small amount of right intraorbital emphysema, subjacent to an oblique fracture through that orbital roof. There is extensive acute hemorrhage within the nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus, bilaterally, with a blood-fluid level within the left maxillary antrum. Review of bone window images demonstrates extensive comminution of the vertex skull fracture, with one dominant component continuing in an oblique coronal plane and traversing the lateral wall and medial aspect of the right orbit, exiting through the ipsilateral anterior clinoid process, as well as the sphenoid sinus and the basisphenoid portion of the clivus. Note that though there is opacification of the right mastoid air cells and small fluid level within the ipsilateral middle ear cavity, no definite right temporal bone fracture is identified (on these 2.5 mm sections).
The dominant fracture component traversing the left frontal extending into the temporal bone continues as a longitudinal fracture involving the mastoid portion of the left temporal bone which, again, is largely fluid-filled with fluid in the aditus ad antrum. The relatively thick sections suggest some degree of dissociation as well as lateral displacement of the ossicular chain, related to the longitudinal fracture. Additionally, there is a suggestion of an oblique-transverse component, extending medially, which transverses the bony vestibule, with the appearance of pneumolabyrinth. Though there is extensive pneumocephalus as well as apparent dural venous gas bubbles, likely related to the series of fractures, described above, there is no definite fracture line traversing the occipital condyles, jugular foramina or hypoglossal or carotid canals, on these sections.
Also noted is extensive ""smash"" fracture involving the nose with extensively comminuted, overriding fractures of both nasal bones, likely involving the bony nasal septum and, probably, the maxillary spine of the nose.
COMMENT: Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 18477**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2455**] (Trauma SICU) at the immediate conclusion of the examination, and recommendation for dedicated temporal bone CT was made.",Are there any bleeding spots on head CT?,"{'text': ['subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous emphysema.

1074666_1_1_O,1074666,"CLINICAL INFORMATION: The patient is an 80-year-old woman with cardiogenic shock from acute MR, with pacemaker in place. A request was made to place a temporary hemodialysis catheter with VIP port.
OPERATORS: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3013**] [**Name (STitle) 3014**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 360**] [**Name (STitle) 65**], the attending radiologist, who was present and supervised during whole procedure.
PROCEDURE: Placement of temporary hemodialysis catheter.
ANESTHESIA: Lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After risks and benefits of the procedure as well as local anesthesia were explained, informed consent was obtained. The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table. The left side of the neck was prepared and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The left internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle under fluoroscopic guidance. Hard copies of the ultrasound were stored. A 0.018 wire was then placed through the needle into the SVC using flouroscopic guidance. A small incision was made over the needle and the needle was removed and replaced with a 4.5 French micropuncture sheath. The wire and the inner 3 French sheath were removed and replaced with a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire with the tip of the [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire terminated in the IVC. The 4.5 French sheath was then removed over the wire and a 12 French dilator was placed over the wire to dilate the soft tissue tract into the left IJ. The dilator was then removed. A 12 French triple lumen 20-cm temporary hemodialysis catheter with a VIP port was then placed over the wire into the left IJ with the tip eventually terminated in the right atrium. All three ports of the catheter were aspirated and flushed easily. The ports were capped. The catheter was sutured to the skin and a sterile dressing was applied.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no immediate complications.",Do we see that the vasculature has patency for hemodialysis line catheter with triple lumen?,"{'text': ['All three ports of the catheter were aspirated and flushed easily'], 'answer_start': [1750]}"

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 325**], Staff Radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.
CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 20 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%, in stomach and [**Last Name (un) **]. IV conscious sedation with divided doses (total 1 mg) of Versed intravenously under continuous hemodynamic monitoring.
PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The procedure was described to the patient's next of [**Doctor First Name **] and informed consent obtained. The previously-placed 14-French pigtail catheter, with the tip in the gastric antrum, was removed over a 0.035 Super Stiff Amplatz wire, and a 5-French sheath was then passed over the wire such that its distal tip was in the antrum of the stomach. A 5-French multi- side-hole catheter was then advanced over the wire, and the wire was exchanged for a 0.035 angled Glidewire. With the image intensifier in a steep left anterior oblique plane, several attempts were made to pass through the post- pyloric region using the Glidewire and with the aid of the catheter, but were unsuccessful. The catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] II catheter, again unsuccessfully. A 5-French [**Location (un) 4398**] catheter was then used in conjunction with the angled Glidewire, and were both manipulated well into the jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz. The wire was then removed, and replaced with the 0.035 Amplatz Super Stiff wire. Both the catheter and 5-French sheath were then removed, and a 14-French peel-away sheath was advanced over the Amplatz Super Stiff wire into the post-pyloric region. A 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**] gastrojejunostomy catheter was then placed through the peel-away sheath following removal of the inner dilator. The sheath was simultaneously removed. The pigtail mechanism was then formed in the third portion of the duodenum, and the tip placed well into the jejunum. A gastrojejunostogram was then performed, and radiographic images were obtained. The final images demonstrate the locking loop mechanism to be projecting over the third portion of the duodenum, with the tip of the catheter well into the jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz. There is contrast material visualized in the body of the stomach and no extravasation. The catheter was then sutured to the patient's skin using 0 Prolene suture material. A Flexi-Track dressing was applied, and sterile gauze applied over the entry site.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the symphysis pubis without the administration of IV contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were obtained.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Visualized lung bases are clear. There is no pleural effusion. The visualized heart and pericardium are unremarkable, without pericardial effusion.
The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. Layering hyperdensity within the gallbladder likely reflects sludge.

MRI HEAD:
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1; axial T2, FLAIR, GRE, DWI, DTI of the head were obtained.
PRELIMINARY READ: ""acute infarct of the right talamus and internal capsule"" by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59168**].
Comparison is made to a concurrent CTA/CTV of the head as well as a prior MRI of the head from [**2114-9-13**].
FINDINGS: There are new small infarcts involving the right thalamus and possibly the posterior limb of the right internal capsule. These infarcts show increased T2- and FLAIR signal, which suggests that they are not hyperacute.
There is encephalomalacia and gliosis involving the right frontal lobe and the left occipital lobe. The previously seen large left parietooccipital hemorrhage has essentially resolved. The previously seen intraventricular hemorrhage has also resolved.
There is a moderate subcortical, deep, and periventricular white matter T2 hyperintensity which likely represent combination of old infarcts and old small vessel disease.
There is gyriform mineralization of the right frontal lobe, left frontal lobe, right parietal lobe, and the left occipital lobe. There is siderosis lining the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally as well as siderosis of the inferior cerebellar hemispheres and brainstem. Mineralization along a right frontal shunt tract is seen. There is stable old hemorrhage within the body of the right lateral ventricle.
The previously seen left to right shift of the normally midline structures and mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle have resolved. The ventricles are normal in size.
MRA/MRV HEAD:
TECHNIQUE: 3D time-of-flight images of the intracranial arterial system as well as oblique 2D time-of-flight images of the intracranial venous system were obtained.
Comparison is made to a concurrent CTA/CTV of the head as well as prior MRV of the head from [**2114-9-13**] and prior CTA/CTV of the head from [**2114-9-3**].
FINDINGS: There is new abrupt termination of the right posterior cerebral artery at its P2 segment which is new since the prior studies.
There is decreased signal within the V3 and V4 segments of the vertebral arteries bilaterally as well as the proximal portion of the basilar artery, not significantly changed since the MR from [**2114-9-13**]. However, the CTA from [**2115-1-17**] shows normal enhancement of these arteries and a congenitally hypoplastic right vertebral artery. Therefore, the MRA findings are most likely are artifactual or technical, and may relate to the small caliber of these vessels.
The MRV shows no significant change since the prior studies. There is partial thrombosis of the left transverse sinus, left sigmoid sinus, and the left internal jugular vein.

TECHNIQUE: Axial imaging of the brain without IV contrast enhancement, followed by helical CT imaging of the major intracranial arteries during rapid infusion of 100 cc of Optiray. Subsequent delayed contrast enhanced images of the brain were obtained.
CT BRAIN W/O IV CONTRAST: The patient's known bilateral mixed density subdural collections are again noted. These appear unchanged in size and extent in the interval.

Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 325**] and [**Doctor Last Name 27**] were present throughout procedure.
CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 20 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%. 100 mcg of Fentanyl and 1 mg Versed were given intravenously in divided doses under continued hemodynamic monitoring for conscious sedation.
PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The procedure was described and informed consent obtained. The stomach was insufflated with air, and point of entry into the body of stomach was marked. Following local anesthetic infiltration, a 19 gauge spinal needle was inserted under fluoroscopic guidance until tenting of the stomach wall was noticed. The lumen of the stomach was then entered, and a flush of air was noted through the spinal needle. At this time, a 0.035 Bentson guidewire was placed through the needle into the lumen of the stomach, and the needle was removed. The tract was then dilated using 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 French dilators under fluoroscopic guidance. A small amount of contrast material was injected during the course of dilatation which again demonstrated gastric location. The tract was continually dilated up to 18 French, and a 16 French MIC gastrostomy tube was advanced over a stiff guidewire. At this time, contrast was injected through the tube and demonstrated its tip to be still in the stomach. A significant amount of previously injected contrast material was noted in a large hiatal hernia projecting above the left hemidiaphragm. With the guidewire projecting over the body and fundus of the stomach, the securing balloon of the MIC gastrostomy tube was inflated with contrast material and normal saline, and was noticed to project outside the body of the stomach. The tube was deflated, the wire removed, and contrast material was then injected directly through the gastrostomy tube, which demonstrated a peritoneal location.
The stomach was reinsufflated with air, and two T-fasteners were placed through the wall of the stomach and secured to the anterior abdominal wall. A 19 gauge needle was then used to access the stomach in an adjacent separate puncture site over the anterior abdominal wall. An 0.035 wire was placed through the needle, the needle removed, the tract dilated to 7 French. A 7 French sheath was then placed over the needle, and access into the gastric antrum was obtained. A 5 French multipurpose catheter was advanced over the guidewire, and the guidewire was exchanged for an angled glidewire. Following several technical manipulations, the guidewire was passed through the first portion of the duodenum and eventually beyond the ligament of Treitz. The multipurpose catheter was advanced over the guidewire, and the glidewire was exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff guidewire. The multipurpose catheter and 7-French sheath were removed, and a 14 French dilator/peelaway sheath was then advanced over the Superstiff guidewire into the duodenum. The inner dilator was removed, and a 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**] gastrojejunstomy catheter was placed through the peelaway sheath. With continued advancement of the catheter through the proximal duodenum, the guidewire in the ligament of Treitz retracted. This in part was due to the lack of flexibility in the gastroduodenal region, secondary to the presence of a large hiatal hernia. At this time, a T-fastener placed previously was noted to have dislodged during advancement of the catheter and peelaway sheath. At this time, four new T- fasteners were placed under fluoroscopic guidance under continued gas insufflation via the NG tube. Access was again gained to the body of the stomach, and a 14 French pigtail catheter was placed fluoroscopic guidance, such that the pigtail formed in the antrum of the stomach. The catheter was secured to the patient's skin using 0 Prolene suture material and Flexitrak dressing.
COMPLICATIONS: Free air was noted under the hemidiaphragms during and following the procedure. The possibility of gastric versus duodenal perforation was a concern, and a CT scan of the abdomen was arranged for the following day.",Was the Gtube placed percutaneously?,"{'text': ['guidewire was placed through the needle into the lumen of the stomach'], 'answer_start': [1153]}"

______________________________________________________________________________
FINAL REPORT HISTORY: Preoperative evaluation for aortic valve replacement, critical aortic stenosis. Also evaluate lung nodule identified on chest radiograph.
COMPARISON: Chest radiograph [**2143-3-15**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen without the administration of IV contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were obtained.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are minimal coronary artery calcifications. Severe calcifications of the aortic valve are noted. There is no significant calcifications of the ascending aorta, which is non-aneurysmal. Minimal atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta are noted. No pericardial effusion is noted.
There are prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, which measure up to 15 mm in short axis in the paratracheal region, which may be reactive.
There are moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions. There is patchy basal airspace opacification in both lower lobes, more on the right, which may represent atelectasis.
Minimal septal thickening in the apices bilaterally may represent resolving intertstitial edema.
There is no pneumothorax. There is a small focus of pleural calcification along the right posterior parietal pleural surface (2:48).
Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.

COMPARISON STUDY: MRI scan of the brain dated [**2115-1-17**] and reported by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 2009**] as revealing ""new occlusion of the right posterior cerebral artery at its P2 segment. Stable partial thromboses of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses as well as left internal jugular vein. Near- complete thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. Partial thrombosis of the right internal cerebral vein and basal vein of [**Doctor Last Name 4323**] while their counterparts on the left are probably patent.""
FINDINGS: Comparison with the prior study of [**2115-1-17**] shows a very similar pattern of abnormal FLAIR signal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. Some of these areas continue to have hemosiderin residua and have been considered the remnant of prior venous infarcts. There are no areas of abnormal signal on the diffusion-weighted scans to raise the question of an evolving arterial infarct. It should be mentioned that this study does not include MR angiography and thus the present status of the P2 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery, felt to be occluded on the prior study, cannot be re-assessed. The principal arterial vascular flow patterns are identified. There has been no overt change in ventricular size or configuration, either.
TECHNIQUE: Two-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar reconstructions.
FINDINGS: There appears to be negligible change in the extent of the extensive thrombosis of multiple major venous sinuses, described in detail in the prior report. Thus, I do not believe there has been perceptible recanalization. The presence of occlusion of the right basal vein of [**Doctor Last Name 4323**], and likely the ipsilateral internal cerebral vein, is again redemonstrated.",Was there any evidence of venous occlusion?,"{'text': ['extensive thrombosis of multiple major venous sinuses, described in detail in the prior report.

Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2129-12-21**] obtained at 02:25 a.m.
The ET tube tip is approximately 8.3 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm with its tip not included in the field of view. The right internal jugular line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. The pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and most likely in the proximal portion of the right ventricle.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
