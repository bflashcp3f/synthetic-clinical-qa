Patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and sedated. Patient was placed supine on the angiography table and right side of neck as well as existing catheter prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure timeout was performed. An initial scout radiograph demonstrated appropriate position of the existing line. After appropriate measurements were made, a subcutaneous tunnel was created from right anterior chest wall to the skin entry site of the existing catheter. A 14 French AngioDynamics catheter measuring 19 cm tip-to-cuff is pulled through the tunnel, exiting at site of the pre-existing catheter. Both ports of the original catheter were aspirated and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 379**] wire was advanced through one of the ports into the IVC. The existing line was then removed over the [**Doctor Last Name 379**] wire and a peel-away sheath advanced over the wire under fluoroscopic guidance. The [**Doctor Last Name 379**] wire and inner dilator were then removed. The double-lumen HD catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath and the sheath removed. Post-procedural chest x-ray demonstrated appropriate positioning of the dialysis catheter with tip positioned in the right atrium. Both ports aspirated and flushed easily. The skin incision over the venopuncture site closed with 4-0 Vicryl and the catheter anchored to the skin with 0-silk sutures.

The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal intensity. The pericardium appeared normal in thickness. There was a small (< 1.0 cm), circumferential pericardial effusion. There were bilateral pleural effusions. The origins of the left main and right coronary arteries were identified in their customary positions. The diameters of the ascending aorta, descending aorta, and main pulmonary artery were normal. The left atrial AP dimension was mildly increased. The left atrial dimensions in the 4-chamber view was mildly increased. The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was mildly enlarged. The left ventricular end-diastolic volume index was moderately elevated. The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction was severely depressed at 29%, with severe regional and global systolic function. There was severe global hypokinesis/akinesis with relative sparing of the basal and mid portions of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The left ventricular mass was normal. The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index was normal. The calculated right ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 51%, with normal regional and global systolic function. The aortic valve was trileaflet with normal valve area.\nQuantitative Flow There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt. Aortic flow demonstrated no significant aortic regurgitation. There was no significant mitral regurgitation. The right ventricular stroke volume and pulmonic flow demonstrated mild pulmonic and tricuspid regurgitation.\nViability There was hyperenhancement of the basal anterior septum, the mid and distal portions of the inferoseptal, anteroseptal, anterior, and anterolateral segments, and the apex. The hyperenhancement was transmural, consistent with poor (<20%) likelihood of functional recovery after segment revascularization.

However, both of these vessels appear to be intact. There is no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation. The visualized intracranial arterial circulation is otherwise normal.\nDELAYED CONTRAST ENHANCED CT IMAGES OF THE BRAIN: The previously described hyperdensity corresponds to a lobular mass abutting the left anterior clinoid and adjacent suprasellar space. This lesion demonstrates modest contrast enhancement and contains punctate calcifications within it.

Long-term feeding required.\nRADIOLOGISTS: Drs.

Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 325**] and [**Doctor Last Name 27**] were present throughout procedure.\nCONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 20 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%. 100 mcg of Fentanyl and 1 mg Versed were given intravenously in divided doses under continued hemodynamic monitoring for conscious sedation.\nPROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The procedure was described and informed consent obtained. The stomach was insufflated with air, and point of entry into the body of stomach was marked. Following local anesthetic infiltration, a 19 gauge spinal needle was inserted under fluoroscopic guidance until tenting of the stomach wall was noticed. The lumen of the stomach was then entered, and a flush of air was noted through the spinal needle. At this time, a 0.035 Bentson guidewire was placed through the needle into the lumen of the stomach, and the needle was removed. The tract was then dilated using 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 French dilators under fluoroscopic guidance. A small amount of contrast material was injected during the course of dilatation which again demonstrated gastric location. The tract was continually dilated up to 18 French, and a 16 French MIC gastrostomy tube was advanced over a stiff guidewire. At this time, contrast was injected through the tube and demonstrated its tip to be still in the stomach. A significant amount of previously injected contrast material was noted in a large hiatal hernia projecting above the left hemidiaphragm. With the guidewire projecting over the body and fundus of the stomach, the securing balloon of the MIC gastrostomy tube was inflated with contrast material and normal saline, and was noticed to project outside the body of the stomach. The tube was deflated, the wire removed, and contrast material was then injected directly through the gastrostomy tube, which demonstrated a peritoneal location.\nThe stomach was reinsufflated with air, and two T-fasteners were placed through the wall of the stomach and secured to the anterior abdominal wall. A 19 gauge needle was then used to access the stomach in an adjacent separate puncture site over the anterior abdominal wall. An 0.035 wire was placed through the needle, the needle removed, the tract dilated to 7 French. A 7 French sheath was then placed over the needle, and access into the gastric antrum was obtained. A 5 French multipurpose catheter was advanced over the guidewire, and the guidewire was exchanged for an angled glidewire. Following several technical manipulations, the guidewire was passed through the first portion of the duodenum and eventually beyond the ligament of Treitz. The multipurpose catheter was advanced over the guidewire, and the glidewire was exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff guidewire. The multipurpose catheter and 7-French sheath were removed, and a 14 French dilator/peelaway sheath was then advanced over the Superstiff guidewire into the duodenum. The inner dilator was removed, and a 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**] gastrojejunstomy catheter was placed through the peelaway sheath. With continued advancement of the catheter through the proximal duodenum, the guidewire in the ligament of Treitz retracted. This in part was due to the lack of flexibility in the gastroduodenal region, secondary to the presence of a large hiatal hernia. At this time, a T-fastener placed previously was noted to have dislodged during advancement of the catheter and peelaway sheath. At this time, four new T- fasteners were placed under fluoroscopic guidance under continued gas insufflation via the NG tube. Access was again gained to the body of the stomach, and a 14 French pigtail catheter was placed fluoroscopic guidance, such that the pigtail formed in the antrum of the stomach. The catheter was secured to the patient's skin using 0 Prolene suture material and Flexitrak dressing.\nCOMPLICATIONS: Free air was noted under the hemidiaphragms during and following the procedure. The possibility of gastric versus duodenal perforation was a concern, and a CT scan of the abdomen was arranged for the following day.", "qas": [{"id": "748220_2_1_O", "question": "Was the Gtube placed percutaneously?", "answers": [{"answer_id": "748220_2_1_O_AP", "text": "guidewire was placed through the needle into the lumen of the stomach", "answer_start": 1153}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "748220_1_1_O", "question": "was the placement of G tube successful?", "answers": [{"answer_id": "748220_1_1_O_AP", "text": "Free air was noted under the hemidiaphragms", "answer_start": 4232}], "is_impossible": false}], "document_id": "748220_O"}]}, {"title": "819816", "paragraphs": [{"context": "IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion with exercise, with an ejection fraction of 67%.\n/nkg\n\n[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2943**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2944**], M.D. [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 476**], M.D. Approved: TUE [**2196-5-10**] 2:31 PM\n\n\n\nRADLINE [**Telephone/Fax (1) 249**]; A radiology consult service.

There is marked cardiac enlargement. It involves mostly a left ventricular prominence to the left and posteriorly but also a moderate degree of left atrial enlargement can be identified with double contour on the frontal view and bulge posteriorly on the lateral projection. The thoracic aorta is moderately widened and elongated and calcium deposits are seen in the wall, mostly at the level of the arch. There are probably also some linear calcifications in the aortic valve area, but somewhat obscured by overlying vascular structures. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.

A discrete collection of blood layers anterior to the pericardium and superior to the heart, consistent with an anterior mediastinal hematoma, measuring approximately 7.0 x 4.0 x 11.0 cm. A small amount of high- density fluid is also present within the pericardium consistent with hemopericardium.\nThe ascending aorta is dilated up to 5.0 cm. There are extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch with wall irregularity at this level (series 400b, image 35) consistent with penetrating ulcers and likely the source for aortic leak given the circumferential hematoma around the arch. There is no evidence of aortic pseudoaneurysm, dissection, or transection, and no active extravasation is seen at this time. The great vessels are patent. The pulmonary arterial tree opacifies well. The left vertebral artery originates directly off the aortic arch between the left common carotid and subclavian arteries, an anatomic variant. The trachea and airways to the segmental level are patent. There is no evidence of ventricular aneurysm or rupture.\nEvaluation of the lungs demonstrates moderate background emphysematous changes. There is mild biapical scarring. There is a small amount of left pleural fluid which measures 30HU, indicating a small hemothorax. Dependent atelectasis is mild. There are small areas of smooth pleural thickening of the lateral pleura of the right upper and middle lobes, (series 3, image 35). There is no pneumothorax.\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A small subcentimeter hypodense focus of the right hepatic lobe is too small to characterize. The gallbladder, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The pancreatic duct is top normal in caliber. No obstructing stones are seen. There is a diverting colostomy in the left lower quadrant. There is herniation of a small amount of intraperitoneal fat through the abdominal wall ostomy defect. There are bilateral simple renal cysts, the larger is exophytic on the left measuring 9.4 cm in diameter. There is no free gas or fluid within the abdomen.\nThere is heavy arthrosclerotic change of the abdominal aorta, which is tortuous and ectatic. Proximal to the aortic bifurcation, the aorta measures up to a caliber of 3.2 cm. The iliac arteries also show heavy atherosclerotic change. The origins of the celiac axis, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 257**] are calcified; however, these vessels and their major branches appear patent.\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Numerous brachytherapy seeds are present within the prostate gland, which is enlarged. The urinary bladder is distended with contrast. There is a right inguinal hernia with protrusion of a small portion of small bowel, but no evidence of incarceration or obstruction. There is no free pelvic fluid. There are numerous sigmoid diverticula, but no evidence of acute diverticulitis.\nBONE WINDOWS: Wedge deformity of the L2 vertebral body is probably chronic.

A preprocedure timeout was performed documenting the nature of procedure and the patient identity. The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the indwelling left neck/left dialysis catheter was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. Initial scout radiograph demonstrated appropriate positioning of the line. First, attention was made towards creation of a tract. Appropriate measurements were made and the subcutaneous tissues were anesthetized with epinephrine buffered lidocaine. A small incision was made and the dialysis catheter was tunneled through the left chest wall subcutaneous tissue. The indwelling catheter was then aspirated removing all heparin and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 66**] wire was advanced through the indwelling lumen into the IVC. The previously placed line was then removed over a wire and a 16 French sheath/dilator device was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the SVC. The indwelling [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire and dilator device were then removed and the dual-lumen dialysis catheter was advanced through the peel-away sheath. Post-procedural radiograph demonstrated appropriate positioning of the dialysis catheter with the tip in the right atrium. The skin [**Doctor Last Name 695**] near the jugular access entry point was closed with 2-0 Vicryl and the catheter was secured with 0 silk. Sterile dressings were applied.

The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced centrally. As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip positioned centrally.\nCLINICIANS: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the attending radiologist, reviewed the study.\nANESHTESIA: Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.\nPROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the procedure and risks involved to the patient. The left upper arm including the existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.\nInitial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla. Attempts to either aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were unsuccessful. A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla. At this stage, a small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating the catheter to be extravascular. Therefore, the catheter was removed. A new access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access. A 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla. Therefore, a small amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the level of axilla. A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC. A 5 French Kumpe catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC line wire. The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally. The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings were applied. Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.

IV conscious sedation with divided doses (total 1 mg) of Versed intravenously under continuous hemodynamic monitoring.\nPROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The procedure was described to the patient's next of [**Doctor First Name **] and informed consent obtained. The previously-placed 14-French pigtail catheter, with the tip in the gastric antrum, was removed over a 0.035 Super Stiff Amplatz wire, and a 5-French sheath was then passed over the wire such that its distal tip was in the antrum of the stomach. A 5-French multi- side-hole catheter was then advanced over the wire, and the wire was exchanged for a 0.035 angled Glidewire. With the image intensifier in a steep left anterior oblique plane, several attempts were made to pass through the post- pyloric region using the Glidewire and with the aid of the catheter, but were unsuccessful. The catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] II catheter, again unsuccessfully. A 5-French [**Location (un) 4398**] catheter was then used in conjunction with the angled Glidewire, and were both manipulated well into the jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz. The wire was then removed, and replaced with the 0.035 Amplatz Super Stiff wire. Both the catheter and 5-French sheath were then removed, and a 14-French peel-away sheath was advanced over the Amplatz Super Stiff wire into the post-pyloric region. A 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**] gastrojejunostomy catheter was then placed through the peel-away sheath following removal of the inner dilator. The sheath was simultaneously removed. The pigtail mechanism was then formed in the third portion of the duodenum, and the tip placed well into the jejunum. A gastrojejunostogram was then performed, and radiographic images were obtained. The final images demonstrate the locking loop mechanism to be projecting over the third portion of the duodenum, with the tip of the catheter well into the jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz. There is contrast material visualized in the body of the stomach and no extravasation. The catheter was then sutured to the patient's skin using 0 Prolene suture material.

Under 1% Lidocaine local anesthesia, the right common femoral artery was accessed with a 19-gauge needle and a .035 [**Last Name (un) 414**] wire was advanced into the abdominal aorta through the needle. The needle was exchanged for a 7 French [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 4740**] catheter, which was advanced over the wire into the ascending aorta with the tip just above the aortic valve. An aortogram was performed in RPO and LPO projections respectively with injection of nonionic contrast.

Next, the abdomen was prepped and draped in sterile manner. The stomach was insufflated with air. Under fluoroscopic guidance, after local lidocaine administration, a needle was advanced into the stomach, and a T-Tack was deployed. Location was confirmed with contrast injection. Sequentially, two additional T-tacks were deployed. Following this, an 18-gauge needle was used to access the stomach, for which an 0.035 J-wire was advanced. Sequential fascial dilatation was performed followed by placement of a 12-French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 7943**] tube. The pigtail was formed within the stomach.

The patient had a previous angiogram on the previous day. The patient was moving and it was difficult to catheterize the right internal and right vertebral arteries at the time. Hence the patient was brought back and the present angiogram was performed under general anesthesia.\nTECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient's family after explaining the risks, indications and alternative management. Risks explained included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent, with possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.\nThe patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions. Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire was introduced and the needle taken out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 units of heparin in 1000 cc of saline).\nThe following blood vessels were selectively catherized, and arteriograms were performed from these locations: right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right vertebral artery.\nPlease note that the previous dicatation has been lost in the process of transcription. This is a redictation.\nRIGHT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY: No significant atherosclerotic disease noted.\nRIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: There is good opacification of the proximal and distal right internal carotid artery, anterior and middle cerebral artery branches.

No intravenous contrast was administered due to the patient's impaired renal function. Coronal and sagittal reformats were evaluated.\nCT OF THORAX: Prior median sternotomy noted. There are bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the right side. There is associated collapse with volume loss involving the posterior basal segments of both the right and left lower lobes. More confluent airspace opacity is seen radiating from the hila to involve the posterior and apical segments of the right upper lobe. The right middle lobe remains well aerated. Findings are most in keeping with pulmonary edema. Ground-glass change is also seen involving the left upper lobe again in keeping with less severe pulmonary edema. Satisfactory position of the right-sided PICC line with the tip terminating in the lower SVC. Dense calcification of the left coronary artery are seen. There are multiple nonenlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes.

Hyperdense material is noted among the necrosis, most conspicuous in images 2:62-64, concerning for extraluminal oral contrast from fistulization of the adjacent bowel. Scattered pockets of tiny free air along the adjacent bowel loop, also suggestive of microperforation. There is no definite bowel obstruction. Colostomy is again noted in the left lower quadrant. The large collection of soft tissue and fluid is again noted in the mid pelvis, amorphous and difficult to assess the boundary.

For detailed description of the extensive facial, sinus and temporal bone fractures, please see separate report of concurrent head CT. There are ET and NG tubes in situ \"tamponading\" the prevertebral soft tissues, and limiting their evaluation. However, no gross prevertebral soft tissue hematoma is identified. The cervical alignment is, overall, intact and the normal lordosis is maintained, with only minimal retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 and C5 on C6, likely related to disc and facet joint degenerative disease. The atlantoaxial and atlanto-occipital alignment is maintained and no skull fracture is demonstrated to involve the skull base, itself. No acute cervical spine fracture is identified. There are multilevel degenerative changes, most prominent at the anterior atlantoaxial articulation, as well as the C5-6 and C6-7 levels, where there are relatively [**Name2 (NI) 2336**] disc-spondylotic ridges, which do not significantly narrow the ventral spinal canal. There is moderate right neuroforaminal narrowing at C5-6 and more mild right neuroforaminal narrowing at the C6-7 levels, but no other significant neuroforaminal narrowing is seen.\nThere is no abnormal air within the cervical soft tissues, and the cervical airway appears grossly intact with ET tube in place.

The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table. The left side of the neck was prepared and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The left internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle under fluoroscopic guidance. Hard copies of the ultrasound were stored. A 0.018 wire was then placed through the needle into the SVC using flouroscopic guidance. A small incision was made over the needle and the needle was removed and replaced with a 4.5 French micropuncture sheath. The wire and the inner 3 French sheath were removed and replaced with a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire with the tip of the [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire terminated in the IVC. The 4.5 French sheath was then removed over the wire and a 12 French dilator was placed over the wire to dilate the soft tissue tract into the left IJ. The dilator was then removed.

He began a progressive, devastating, debiliting decline. Now, he suffers from multiple medical problems and pontine infarctions which have essentially left him near \"locked-in\". On [**1-6**], the patient underwent MRA which suggested long segmental areas of narrowing in the basilar. The patient has not tolerated long-term conservative therapy and angioplasty/stenting is considered. The patient and his family participated in a family meeting when all options were discussed extensively with the patient and family on Friday of last week and the treatment is now attempted this Monday ([**2109-2-11**]).\nPROCEDURE: The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure are explained to the patient and his children. They understand and sign the consent form.\nThe patient is brought to the neurointerventional suite and placed under general anesthesia. A Swan-Ganz catheter is placed via left subclavian approach, radial A line is present.\nThe groin is prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Using standard Seldinger technique a 6 French Arrow sheath was placed in the groin. Arteriogram was performed through the dilator and demonstrates an extremely tortuous iliac and femoral system. Ultimately, a sheath exchange is performed over an exchange length 038 microwire for a 25 cm 6 French bright tip sheath. Utilizing a combination of 5 French Berenstein, 5 French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 2, 5 French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 3 in conjunction with long tapered Terumo glidewire and standard Terumo glidewire the following vessels are selected:\nThe 5 French Berenstein catheter is used to select the right common carotid artery. The carotid bifurcation is studied in AP and lateral projections utilizing road map technique. There is no significant stenosis. The catheter is placed in the internal carotid artery and the camera centered over the head. Arteriographic assessment in the AP and lateral planes demonstrates filling of the posterior cerebral territory, predominantly via leptomeningeal collaterals to the posterior cerebral. There is extensive intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Venous drainage is predominantly to the right side.\nNext, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1408**] 3 catheter is used to select the left common carotid artery. Examination is performed over the head via hand injection utilizing AP and lateral films. Again, seen are areas of atherosclerotic narrowing. There is a large posterior communicator with direct supply to the posterior cerebral on this left side.\nNext, the 5 French Berenstein catheter is put into the base of the left vertebral artery. This is studied in the neck in AP and lateral positions. Then, the camera was centered in the brain and studied in AP and lateral positions. The left vertebral is an extremely tortuous vessel with a complete 360 degree turn in its base. The anterior spinal access is a large access arising from this artery with prominent spinal drainage seen on this examination. There is no filling of the basilar on this injection. The distal vertebral flows into the posterior inferior cerebellar. The posterior inferior cerebellar supplies anastomosis to the superior cerebellar artery.\nNext, the 5 French Berenstein was placed into the right subclavian. Injection and examination of the right subclavian was done with the blood pressure cuff placed on the right arm. The right vertebral is a small vessel that appears to terminate in a small PICA. The basilar was not filled. As the caliber of the vertebral was smaller than the catheter being utilized, it was decided to not enter the vertebral.\nThe examination is discussed extensively with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37273**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15994**] of Stroke Neurology. After extensive discussion, the decision is made to stop at this point.\nThe long sheath is changed for a short 6 French sheath. The heparin is D/C.

There is a severe acute soft tissue injury with large right frontal and left parietovertex soft tissue swelling, subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous emphysema. This is associated with an extensive, circumferential oblique- coronal skull fracture which traverses the right frontal and left temporal bones, as well as the sphenoid bone and clivus, described in more detail below. The right frontal fracture is associated with a focal lentiform extra- axial hematoma measuring roughly 8 mm in thickness and 3.5 cm in maximal transverse dimension. This demonstrates a relatively low-attenuation portion, anteriorly, which may represent acute, non-clotted blood. This collection may be bounded by the coronal suture, and therefore lie in the epidural space. There is moderate subarachnoid hemorrhage occupying the immediately subjacent sulci, which are slightly flattened, due to the mass effect of the hematoma. No definite adjacent parenchymal contusion is seen, and there is no associated shift of the midline structures or mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral ventricle. There is no evidence of subfalcine, uncal or downward transtentorial herniation. No significant extra-axial hematoma is identified at the corresponding left frontotemporal fracture site, though there is subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci in this region, and there may be a small parenchymal contusion, at the level of the left sylvian fissure.\nThere is extensive left supra- and periorbital soft tissue edema and hemorrhage, which does not appear to violate the orbital cone, and the retrobulbar fat in both orbits, as well as the periorbita, is preserved, though there is a small amount of right intraorbital emphysema, subjacent to an oblique fracture through that orbital roof. There is extensive acute hemorrhage within the nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus, bilaterally, with a blood-fluid level within the left maxillary antrum. Review of bone window images demonstrates extensive comminution of the vertex skull fracture, with one dominant component continuing in an oblique coronal plane and traversing the lateral wall and medial aspect of the right orbit, exiting through the ipsilateral anterior clinoid process, as well as the sphenoid sinus and the basisphenoid portion of the clivus. Note that though there is opacification of the right mastoid air cells and small fluid level within the ipsilateral middle ear cavity, no definite right temporal bone fracture is identified (on these 2.5 mm sections).\nThe dominant fracture component traversing the left frontal extending into the temporal bone continues as a longitudinal fracture involving the mastoid portion of the left temporal bone which, again, is largely fluid-filled with fluid in the aditus ad antrum. The relatively thick sections suggest some degree of dissociation as well as lateral displacement of the ossicular chain, related to the longitudinal fracture. Additionally, there is a suggestion of an oblique-transverse component, extending medially, which transverses the bony vestibule, with the appearance of pneumolabyrinth. Though there is extensive pneumocephalus as well as apparent dural venous gas bubbles, likely related to the series of fractures, described above, there is no definite fracture line traversing the occipital condyles, jugular foramina or hypoglossal or carotid canals, on these sections.\nAlso noted is extensive \"smash\" fracture involving the nose with extensively comminuted, overriding fractures of both nasal bones, likely involving the bony nasal septum and, probably, the maxillary spine of the nose.\nCOMMENT: Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 18477**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2455**] (Trauma SICU) at the immediate conclusion of the examination, and recommendation for dedicated temporal bone CT was made.", "qas": [{"id": "959075_1_1_O", "question": "Are there any bleeding spots on head CT?", "answers": [{"answer_id": "959075_1_1_O_AP", "text": "subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous emphysema.

Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the attending radiologist, supervised and reviewed the study.\nANESTHESIA: 1% local lidocaine.\nPROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained. The potential risks of radiation in a pregnant patient were also reviewed and confirmed with the patient. She was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table. Her abdomen was shielded and the neck and indwelling right pheresis catheter were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A pre-procedural timeout and huddle were performed per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol. Under ultrasound guidance with hard copy images on file, a micropuncture set was used to access the left internal jugular vein and a 0.018 wire was advanced into the SVC. This was subsequently exchanged for a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire. A 12 French x 16 cm pheresis catheter with VIP was selected and after sequential fascial dilatation, the catheter was placed over the wire with the tip positioned in the distal SVC. The catheter was secured to the skin with 0 silk suture. The catheter was flushed and aspirated well. A final fluoroscopic spot image demonstrated good position of the catheter and no pneumothorax.\nThe patient was then placed on a gurney and the indwelling right pheresis catheter was removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complication.", "qas": [{"id": "1130750_1_2_O", "question": "What is the location of triple lumen pheresis line?", "answers": [{"answer_id": "1130750_1_2_O_MG", "text": "tip positioned in the distal SVC", "answer_start": 1385}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "1130750_1_1_O", "question": "How was the placement of temporary triple lumen pheresis line ?", "answers": [{"answer_id": "1130750_1_1_O_AP", "text": "patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complication", "answer_start": 1765}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "1130750_2_1_O", "question": "Was the triple lumen pheresis line placed?", "answers": [{"answer_id": "1130750_2_1_O_MG", "text": "catheter was placed", "answer_start": 1342}], "is_impossible": false}], "document_id": "1130750_O"}]}, {"title": "1084509", "paragraphs": [{"context": "IMPRESSION", "qas": [{"id": "1084509_2_1_I", "question": "Is there evidence of edema?", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"id": "1084509_1_1_I", "question": "What does the chest x ray show in the lungs - edema or pneumonia?", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"id": "1084509_2_2_I", "question": "Was there evidence of pneumonia?", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "document_id": "1084509_I"}, {"context": "WET READ: [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 792**] [**Doctor First Name 38**] [**2188-7-17**] 9:38 PM NO ACUTE INTRATHORACIC PATHOLOGY.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nFINAL REPORT HISTORY: Preoperative for CABG.\nFINDINGS: No previous images.

[The noncontrast CT images are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.] A series of overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 96 mg/dL. The area imaged spanned the region from the orbits to the thighs.\nComputed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake. The determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important implications regarding the significance of that uptake.\nINTERPRETATION:\nHEAD/NECK: A large, lobulated mass with hetergeneous solid and cystic components arises from the right thyroid lobe and extends into the superior neck at the level of the mandible. This lesion measures 7.3 cm TV x 5.2 cm AP x 8.2 cm CC, with SUVmax of 24.13. There is severe mass effect on and compression of the trachea and esophagus.\nNo FDG-avid intracranial lesions are seen in the imaged skull base.\nCHEST: A long-segment region of circumferential wall thickening up to 1.5 cm is present in the mid-to-distal esophagus, with SUVmax of 35.12. This abnormality spans a craniocaudal distance of approximately 9.4 cm, from the level of the carina to just above the gastroesophageal junction.\nAn upper right paratracheal node measures 1.4 cm, with SUVmax of 17.45. 3-mm pulmonary nodule in the anterior right upper lobe is non-FDG-avid. Thoracic aortic and three-vessel coronary artery calcifications are present.\nABDOMEN/PELVIS: No FDG-avid lesions are seen in the abdomen and pelvis.

The patient was brought to the angiography suite and laid in supine position. The right neck was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion. A preprocedure timeout and huddle were performed. The patient's right neck was examined with ultrasound, demonstrating a patent and compressible right internal jugular vein. This vein was cannulated with a micropuncture needle just above the clavicles. Pre- and post-cannulation images were obtained and printed. A guidewire was advanced into the SVC through the needle. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath. The inner dilator and wire were removed and exchanged for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 379**] wire, which was extended down into the upper right atrium. The sheath was exchanged for a 14 French dilator. Following dilation, the 15 cm triple lumen dialysis/pheresis catheter including VIP port was advanced over the wire with tip terminating in the high right atrium.

Targeted ultrasound of the left axilla was performed, demonstrating several normal-appearing fatty replaced lymph nodes.\nFollowing explanation of the procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives, written informed consent was obtained with the assistance of a Russian interpreter. A preprocedure timeout was performed using three patient identifiers.\nUsing standard aseptic technique and 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, under ultrasound guidance, multiple core biopsies were obtained of the hypoechoic mass in the retroareolar left breast using a 14-gauge coaxial spring-loaded biopsy device. A percutaneous clip was subsequently placed at the site of biopsy under ultrasound guidance. The needle was removed and hemostasis was achieved.\nPost-procedure mammogram demonstrates accurate deployment of the percutaneous clip in the retroareolar left mass.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.
