INDICATION: Lung nodules. Recent treatment for COPD flare.
TECHNIQUE: Volumetric, multidetector CT acquisition of the chest was performed without intravenous or oral contrast. Images are presented for display in the axial plane at 5-mm and 1.25-mm collimation. A series of multiplanar reformation images were also submitted for review.
FINDINGS: Several small, less than or equal to 5 mm diameter lung nodules are without change from the prior examination, including a 5-mm right lower lobe nodule (151, 4) and several smaller nodules located in the right middle lobe (151, 4), lingula (153, 4), right middle lobe (41, 3) and left lower lobe (34, 3). Apparent partial fat attenuation in the periphery of the left lower lobe (156, 4) is likely unchanged but is difficult to directly compare due to a new area of adjacent consolidation within the left lower lobe. Streaky peribronchovascular opacities are again demonstrated within the posterior segments of both lower lobes, and there are also new linear opacities within the right middle lobe and lingula. Previously reported bronchiolitis pattern in right lower lobe has resolved. Areas of bronchial wall thickening persist in the posterior segments of both lower lobes and are now associated with areas of peribronchiolar consolidation within the left lower lobe. Upper lobe-predominant emphysema, moderate in severity, is again demonstrated.
No enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are identified. Heart size is normal. Small amount of pericardial fluid is slightly changed in distribution but unchanged in amount since the prior CT. A small hiatal hernia is again demonstrated. New trace left pleural effusion has developed.
Exam was not tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region, but adrenal glands are well visualized and normal in appearance. Remaining imaged upper abdomen is remarkable for previous cholecystectomy.

INDICATIONS: This patient is a 79-year-old male with an asymptomatic 7-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm noted incidentally on a CT scan for a small bowel obstruction. He presents for aortogram with evaluation for possible endograft repair.
MEDICATIONS AND CONTRAST: The patient received no IV sedation during the procedure, however was continuously hemodynamically monitored throughout the case. 8 cc of 1% lidocaine were used as local anesthesia and a total of 240 cc of Optiray 60% contrast was used throughout the case.
TECHNIQUE: After consent was obtained, patient was placed in the supine position on the fluoroscopy table and the right groin was shaved, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile manner. Common femoral artery was identified with the aid of fluoroscopic guidance using bony landmarks. 8 cc of 1% lidocaine local anesthesia were infiltrated at the site of the right common femoral artery and a 19-gauge single wall puncture needle was introduced into the right common femoral artery after a small skin [**Doctor Last Name **] was made with an #11 blade and 0.035"" Bentson guidewire was then advanced through the needle and into the lower abdominal aorta. A 5-French sheath was then placed over the wire and its side arm was flushed throughout the case with heparinized saline. Over the wire, a 5-French marked Omniflush catheter was inserted to the level of L1 and abdominal aortogram was performed including AP and lateral views. The catheter tip was then withdrawn to the level of the lower abdominal aorta and right and left anterior oblique views of the pelvic arteriogram were performed. Subsequently, a bilateral femoral arteriogram was performed. The catheter was removed. The sheath was removed and adequate hemostasis was achieved with manual pressure at the puncture site. The patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate complications were noted.
FINDINGS: The celiac trunk is patent, although mild stenosis of the proximal celiac trunk is noted on the lateral view of the aorta. Patent single bilateral renal arteries are noted with the left renal artery being lower than the right. Distance from the lower renal artery to the aortic bifurcation is 13 cm.

______________________________________________________________________________
FINAL REPORT INDICATION: Patient with recent pericarditis, tamponade of unclear etiology. Evaluate pericardium.
TECHNIQUE: A CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed following administration of IV and oral contrast.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: A small amount of pericardial fluid is seen anteriorly and posteriorly with no evidence of loculation. The pericardium enhances, but is not particularly thickened measuring approximately 2 mm. These findings are in keeping with the history of pericarditis. There is no axillary, mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. Small bilateral pleural effusions are seen with adjacent compressive atelectasis. There are no intravascular filling defects with pulmonary arterial branches to suggest PE. A non- specific density is visualized within the main pulmonary artery, of unclear etiology. The central airways are patent.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The patient is S/P cholecystectomy. The common duct is dilated to 12 mm, possibly due to ampullary stenosis; however, a retained stone cannot definitively be excluded. Pneumobilia is likely related to a previous sphincterotomy. There are no focal hepatic lesions. The liver, spleen, adrenals and pancreas are normal in appearance. The kidneys enhance promptly and symmetrically with sub-cm bilateral low attenuation lesions which are too small to characterize. There is no hydronephrosis. Small retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen. There is no ascites. The bowel is unremarkable.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is in place. Evaluation of the pelvis is limited secondary to streak artifact from a right hip prosthesis. A left common iliac artery stent is in place. The patient has had previous bypass surgery in the left groin region with post-operative changes.
