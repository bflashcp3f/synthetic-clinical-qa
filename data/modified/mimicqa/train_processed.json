in 1998. he received transurethral resection of the prostate one year ago because of persistent urinary retention. after that, he was on lupron and nilandron hormone therapy. the patient was admitted on february 23, 1999 to eifro medical center because of failure to thrive and decreased hematocrit. he was noted to have elevated bun and creatinine. bun was 34 and creatinine was 2.6, up from his baseline of 1.0. prostate specific antigen increased from 77.9 to 88, and the patient also had urinary incontinence and body weight loss. further evaluation of his renal failure showed that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis, most likely obstructive uropathy due to prostate ca in the pelvic area. because of the increasing creatinine to 8.0 on february 28, 1999, a left nephrostomy tube was placed. however after the procedure, the patient 's hematocrit dropped to 24 and he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells. his hematocrit increased to about 30, but he continued to have hematuria and his renal function only improved very slowly. he also received kayexalate for hyperkalemia. due to the persistent blood in the urine, he was transferred from eifro medical center to the retelk county medical center for angiographic studies to rule out any vascular injuries. the patient was transferred to genearocktemp ry health on march 3, 1999. review of systems : the patient

which may cause further damage to the patient 's kidney. urology consultation thinks that cystoscopy would not add any benefit to the management and only would consider a right nephrostomy if renal function failed to improve. after admission, the patient was treated conservatively to correct his electrolyte and metabolic acidosis. he was given blood transfusion, two units when his hematocrit dropped to 29.4. after transfusion, the patient 's hematocrit rose to 37.7 on the day of discharge. the patient was also given sodium bicarbonate to correct his metabolic acidosis. he continued to

old man who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit status post cardiac arrest. history was obtained per the emergency department report as well as from the patient 's family. information was very limited regarding the circumstances of his cardiac arrest. reportedly, the patient was at a local restaurant where he was noted to be unresponsive. ems was called and reported to arrive on scene within three minutes. the patient was asystolic but regained a perfusing rhythm after 2 mg of epinephrine and 2 mg of atropine. he was intubated in the field and brought to the emergency department. he remained unresponsive despite the administration of narcan. ct examinations of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis were all unremarkable. initial chest x-ray showed a left retrocardiac opacity and prominent interstitium though his lung volumes were low. subsequent chest x-ray showed right main stem intubation with left lung collapse which had corrected with withdrawal of the endotracheal tube. the patient was then transferred to the medical intensive care unit for induced hypothermia given his hemodynamic stability, ongoing unresponsiveness and recent out of hospital cardiac arrest. past

7.31/46/500/77. hospital course : cardiac arrest - his arrest was of unknown etiology at the time of admission. no further history was ever gained about his cardiac arrest throughout his hospitalization. ct angiogram had been negative for pulmonary embolism. the patient had an echocardiogram on [**2013-04-26**], which showed a normal ejection fraction and trivial mitral regurgitation ; otherwise no obvious abnormalities were seen. given the patient had an out of hospital arrest, remained unresponsive despite hemodynamic stability, he was treated with induced hypothermia and with cold packs and a cooling blanket were placed with goals of reducing his core body temperature to 32 degrees celsius for a period of twelve hours at which point he would be rewarmed over the subsequent six hours. this was done, however, as in problem number two below, we were not successful in any neurologic recovery. neurology - the patient remained unresponsive after the induced hypothermia, the patient was noticed to develop myoclonic jerks and occasional fluttering of his eyelids. electroencephalogram revealed the patient was experiencing persistent seizure activity. neurology was consulted and the patient was treated very aggressively, loaded with multiple drugs, including ativan and propofol drips. the patient continued to demonstrate seizure activity despite this. he was loaded with dilantin and ultimately was treated with a pentobarb coma. after multiple attempts of weaning the pentobarb, the patient was continually reverting to status epilepticus which was never able to be suppressed. infectious disease - over the course of his hospital stay, the patient 's white blood cell count rose to a peak of 17. multiple cultures were done and the patient was ultimately found to have methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. for all these infections, the patient was treated with vancomycin and he was also on levofloxacin and flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia at the time of his admission. blood cultures cleared by [**2013-05-03**]. sputum culture as late as [**2013-05-10**], however was still positive for coagulase positive staphylococcus which was methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus. the patient remained gravely ill throughout his hospital stay and had multiple meetings were held with his

intracranial pressures were normal. that day, cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal. an arch aortogram was normal. over the ensuing twenty-four hours, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring pa line guided fluid and pressors developed. the patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak, decreasing svr, oliguria unresponsive to lasix / mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2, worsening ards, a rise in temperature to 103, and a serum amylase of 1265. he was returned to the operating room on july 4. three liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity. exploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels. because of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in, it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor roux-en-y drainage was feasible. four large flat jackson-pratt drains were placed, and gastrostomy, jejunostomy, and cholecystostomy tubes, as well as a right subclavian quinton catheter were placed. the patient 's hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid, so that he was no longer on pressors. however, upon transfer from the operating room table to the ricu bed, he suffered a cardiac arrest, which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ; the initial arterial blood gas was 32/88/6.92. he was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he was taken to the ricu. continuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on july 5, and continued for most of the remainder of the patient 's course. vancomycin, flagyl, and aztreonam were given for gram negative coccobacilli ( later identified as bacteroides) that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods ( enterobacter) in his peritoneal fluid. he was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome. total parenteral nutrition was started on july 5. initial improvement was followed by recurrence of low svr, high cardiac output, ongoing acidosis, requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range ; drainage from the jackson-pratt drains were minimal despite irrigation and manipulation. the patient was returned to the

present illness : the patient is a 79-year-old man status postradical cystoprostatectomy with ileal loop for locally invasive prostate cancer. this operation was performed 2/11/02 by dr. doje para. the postoperative course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with transfer to the cardiac step-down unit. this transfer occurred around postoperative day 8 for anticoagulation and amiodarone load. the anticoagulation was stopped due to concern for postoperative bleeding. the patient complained of fevers. the patient presented to the emergency room on 3/7/02, complaining of fevers since monday 3/2/02. he developed erythema around the wound on wednesday and was seen by dr. para, who started keflex and obtained a ct scan which demonstrated a fluid collection at the site of erythema. the fevers continued as high as 102.5 degrees f with chills on the morning of admission. he was draining pus from the wound site with subsequent relief of discomfort at the site. past medical history : hypertension, atrial fibrillation, gout. past surgical history : cystoprostatectomy, bilateral inguinal hernia repair. medications on admission : keflex 500 mg qid. allergies : no known drug allergies. physical examination on admission : on presentation, temperature 99.3 degrees f, other vital signs were within normal limits. he was in no acute distress, non-toxic. cardiovascular : regular rate and rhythm. pulmonary : clear to auscultation bilaterally. abdomen soft and there was wound erythema with three areas of dehiscence draining foul-smelling, purulent fluid. the fascia appeared intact by probing. the stoma was pink and functional. the wound was a midline incision for his radical cystoprostatectomy. laboratory data : white blood cell count 16.9, hematocrit 32.2, platelet count 418, sodium 131, potassium 3.4, chloride 102, bicarbonate 21.4, bun27, creatinine 1.4, glucose 150. radiologic studies : ct scan 3/5/02 : a fluid collection external to the fascia consistent with site of erythema. hospital course : the patient was admitted to urology. after the wound was further opened, he was started on ampicillin, gentamicin, and flagyl antibiotics and he was placed on a bid dressing change and packing. on hospital day 2, the patient had no complaints. he was afebrile with stable vital signs and good urine output. the wound erythema was improving and the wound was packed twice a day. wound cultures remained negative at that time. we continued his ampicillin, gentamicin, and flagyl. by hospital day 4, he remained afebrile throughout his hospital course. the wound cultures demonstrated gram-positive cocci in clusters and gram-negative rods. blood cultures remained negative. the patient was continued on antibiotics and we obtained a ct scan to

11/02/1999 principal diagnosis : left sided spastic hemiparesis, status post surgical correction of c-1, c-2 dural avm. history of present illness : ms. breunlinke is a 69 year-old right handed woman, status post surgical correction of a c-1 to c-2 dural avm in january, 1998, now presenting with a one month history of increasing left sided weakness and pain with spasticity, occasional difficulty swallowing and abdominal pain. she was originally admitted to the verg medical center in january, 1998, because of a one year history of left sided weakness and spasticity. she was found to have intermedullary lesion at c1-2 level which on biopsy showed abnormal vasculature, hemosiderin deposit, leading in turn to the discovery of a dural arteriovenous malformation at that level which was surgically corrected. the postoperative period was complicated by transient swallowing difficulty, increasing left sided weakness and urinary retention. she was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation where she made significant progress toward recovery. as of the beginning of september, 1999, she was able to swallow without difficulty, urinate without difficulty ( although bowel movements have been problematic) . functionally, she was at the level of pre-gait training and able to stand and take several steps with upper body support. over the past 4-5 weeks her functional level has progressively deteriorated. she is now unable to stand and needs assistance to sit up. her left arm has developed a flexure contraction and she reports intermitttent pain in the left arm and leg which occurs both spontaneously and is also triggered by contact. she has developed some new swallowing difficulty and since her transfer to a long term inpatient care facility, she has lost ten pounds. she denies dysuria or excessive urinary frequency. over the past several weeks she has also developed severe intermittent abdominal pain, localized to the suprapubic area, left greater than right, occurring intermittently. the patient feels this is secondary to her hemorrhoids, although it does not clearly localize to the rectum. this pain often follows bowel movement but does occur spontaneously. past medical history : significant for insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, hypertension, depression, frequent urinary tract infections, neuropathic pain syndrome and osteoporosis. medication : on admission include cozaar 75 mg q.d, coumadin 2 mg/1 mg alternate days, synthroid 175 mcg q.d, zoloft 50 mg q.d, zantac 150 mg b.i.d, diabeta 25 mg q.d, proctofoam 1%

challenge was performed with a positive response. in addition, a ct angiogram of the chest with pulmonary embolism protocol showed no intravascular filling defect but did show a right upper lobe ground-glass and scattered adenopathy. therefore, in the end left atrial hypertension was essentially ruled out as a primary cause. chronic pulmonary embolus was less likely given her negative ct angiogram. chronic lung disease was unlikely given the patient 's normal pulmonary function tests and dlco in 2012 as well as a normal ct angiogram. collagen vascular disease could not be definitively ruled out ; however, given the patient 's lack of connective tissue disorder stigmata it was thought to be less likely, and the patient 's human immunodeficiency virus test was negative. therefore, it was felt that the patient was most likely experiencing a primary pulmonary hypertension. consideration was given to treating the patient with a course of calcium channel blocker ; however, given the patient 's poor response to lopressor, it was determined that this would not be optimal treatment for the patient 's pulmonary hypertension. therefore, her insurance company was contacted regarding the potential of flolan as a treatment. plans were made for placement of a hickman catheter and initiation of flolan treatment. however, on 12-07, the patient once again experienced an episode of unresponsiveness. upon arrival by the physician the patient was awake, alert, and oriented with a pulse in the 80 s, with pressure in the 80 s, and satting 100% on room air. she described this episode as an uncomfortable feeling in her chest. the patient was treated with 2 liters of intravenous fluids with a bump in her systolic blood pressure to the 90 s. review of telemetry revealed an 8 to 9 beat episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia followed by an episode of bradycardia to 60 beats per minute. the etiology of these cardiovascular episodes was unclear, but was felt likely secondary to the patient 's tenuous cardiovascular status given the fact that she had clear pulmonary hypertension, was very preload dependent, and had an intact left ventricular function but with cardiac output limited due to left ventricular compression by a dilated left ventricle. given the patient 's persistent hypotensive episodes, and decreased urine output, she was transferred back to the medical intensive care unit for management prior to initiation of flolan therapy. on 12-08, the hickman catheter was placed in preparation of flolan administration. during the mass. mental health center medical intensive care unit stay, the patient was found to exquisitely preload dependent and responded well to aggressive fluids as needed to maintain her blood pressure with a systolic of

patient had her hickman in place. because the patient 's pulmonary pressures responded so well to adenosine during right heart catheterization, it was thought that the patient would be a good candidate for flolan therapy. flolan was initiated on 12-08 at 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute. the patient was monitored for symptoms of flolan therapy including nausea, vomiting, first bite jaw claudication, or hypotension. over the course of the hospital stay the patient 's flolan dose was titrated to receive maximum benefit without precipitating symptoms of flolan overdose. the patient was felt to be stable on her current flolan dose and was therefore transferred back to the floor. a high resolution ct was requested to further evaluate for possible secondary cause of her primary pulmonary hypertension ; however, the patient refused it at this time. plans for placement of a pacemaker were initiated. however, on the night prior to the planned surgical date the patient suffered an episode of bleeding from her hickman catheter site. surgery was notified and pressure was applied ; however, it did not stop oozing. a surgicel dressing was placed and prolonged pressure resulted in resolution of the bleeding. in addition, an extra stitch was placed in an effort to stop the bleeding. following this episode the patient felt like she was too stressed for pacemaker placement. therefore, she was monitored over the next few days for any further bleeding events. over the course of the next few days the patient became more accustomed to her flolan, and flolan teaching was continued. she continued to have occasional episodes of dizziness, shortness of breath, and hypotension whenever the alarm sounded suggesting that the flolan bag needed to be changed. however, over the course of the hospital stay these decreased both in frequency and severity. on 12-15, the patient went for placement of a pacemaker. she had dual-mode, dual-pacing, dual-sensing pacemaker placed with a lower rate at 60 ppm, and upper rate of 120 ppm with a paced av of 150 msec. the patient recovered well from her surgery for pacemaker placement. at the time of discharge, the patient was tolerating her flolan therapy well. she had received a full course of flolan teaching and reported that she and her husband felt comfortable with the administration of the medication at home. she was set up with a primary pulmonary hypertension support group, and home services were arranged to help her in the initiation of flolan therapy. following pacemaker placement the patient had no further

nausea and vomiting, fever. 4. history of ovarian cyst resection, 1975. history of present illness : the patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with pbse and ccss support ending june 1994. she was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever, chest wall ulceration, cellulitis and pain control. the patient first presented in october 1991 with a tender right axillary mass. a mammogram done in november 1990 was negative. however, mammography repeated in october 1991 showed bilateral breast masses, suspicious for carcinoma. fine needle aspiration on october 23, 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters. staging evaluation included normal liver function tests, normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray. bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally. dr. berca gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on november 4, 1991. the right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated, grade iii out of iii infiltrating ductal carcinoma. the margins were free of tumor, but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma. furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer. the left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion. estrogen receptor was 0% by erica. the patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage. therefore she had a stage iii-a adenocarcinoma of the breast. since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor, she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy. the patient was treated with cmsap, which is cytoxan, methotrexate, leukovoranrescue, 5-fu, adriamycin and prednisone for four cycles. there were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression. however, following cycle 4, she developed a flu-like illness, followed by fever, nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion. abgs showed a po2 of 79, ph 7.44, po2 33. chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates. the differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis, mycoplasma, chlamydia. basically in december 1993, she returned to the hem / onc clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied. although she had mediastinal recurrence, bone scan, head and liver ct were negative for metastatic disease. she was thus started on a protocol of high dose chemotherapy with gcsf and peripheral stem cell support. complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis. she also developed klebsiella uti after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy. it was treated with gent and cipro. re-staging done in april 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread", "qas": [{"question": "what was done to correct the patient's metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast", "id": "0142_0_0", "answers":

to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with iv antibiotics. so she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called santyl, which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her. also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative taxol chemotherapy, which the patient declined. she refused the taxol therapy so that was not done. another major issue with this patient was pain control. she had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion. so pain control was a big issue so she was on ms contin and msir at home she thought that clouded her thinking, so we tried different things for pain management. one of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at c6-c7 interface on 1-6-94. after that the patient had minimal relief of pain. however, she declined further blocks, which were offered to her. so accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up. she is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch. she is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours. we can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain. other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead ct for her on the 8th of january because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status, which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking. we went ahead and got a head ct scanand it showed no enhancing lesions. in addition her liver transaminases were elevated, we thought about doing further work-up, but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that. that has been stable. the patient on january 13 became hyponatremic. her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133. a renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as siadh. we proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it. we had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction. in addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped, so that now at the time of discharge, the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116. so that has really improved.", "qas": [{"question": "how was the patient's

problems, her blood pressure was elevated also. we put her on nifedipine ir, sl and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic, so we had started her on atenolol. so on discharge she is on atenolol 100. if needed to you can give her some nifedipine sl to decrease her blood pressure. the patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities, so i think that fluid restriction should help with that. she is also a little dry. the patient is on oxygen. ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen. she was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters, sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters. we would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well. the complications that i have listed include the hyponatremia, pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure. disposition : discharge medications - baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d, mvi one tablet p.o. q.d, mycostatin powder tp q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area, also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h, colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d, coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours, atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d. condition on discharge : fair. she remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema. she is to go to the necsoncardel medical center for more chronic care. follow-up is with dr. wedleung in the hem / onc in two weeks. the appointment has already been made. the patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain

omentopexy. associated procedures : 09/02/98 sternal debridement. bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flap. right superiorly based rectus abdominis flap. primary closure of wound. history and reason for hospitalization : the patient is a 79 year old gentleman with a history of an ascending aortic graft replacement in 1991 for aortic dissection. at that time the patient 's hospital course was complicated by a sternal wound infection requiring a sternal debridement and subsequent abdominal flap. the patient was then continued by report on dicloxacillin for approximately one year following that reconstructive operation. the patient apparently did well until june 1998 when he noted a bulge in his sternal area. a ruptured aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the graft and arch was diagnosed and this was subsequently repaired. the patient then had recurrent bleeding two weeks later which was once again repaired. however the same problem recurred for a third time and a computer tomogram scan at an outside hospital showed an anterior hematoma. by report the patient was at that time told that there was no more that could be done for him and was then apparently placed on comfort measures and pain control at the outside hospital. however the patient was then subsequently transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital upon request of the family on 8/24/98 for further evaluation and possible intervention. the patient was evaluated by dr. rhalt of dentvailr. medical center. as the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels. there was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process. at the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the infectious disease service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous unasyn to levofloxacin for what appeared to be citrobacter and diphtheroids in the wound cultures. subsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside. given all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure. the patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed. the patient otherwise complained of no angina, no shortness of breath, no", "qas": [{"question": "what is the patient's current infected aortic graft status", "id": "0058_0_0", "answers": [{"answer_id": "0058_0_0_0", "text":

eugene is a 67 year old male with a remote history of chronic pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse 30 years ago, who is transferred now from rehab hospital of the cape & islands hospital for an ercp and work-up for a cystic lesion at the head of his pancreas on ct scan shown at the outside hospital. the patient presented initially to rehab hospital of the cape & islands hospital at the end of december for abdominal pain, and was found to have pancreatitis. during this admission, two ct scans had shown a question of an enlargement of the head of his pancreas versus early pseudocyst. the patient was discharged home early from this admission due to family needs. while at home, the patient did not do well and could tolerate minimal food intake and lost about 20 pounds in one month. on an office visit on 01-14, the patient was found to have significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase. that evening, the patient again developed abdominal pain like his pancreatitis with nausea and vomiting, for which he was admitted to the rehab hospital of the cape & islands hospital. in the emergency department at the rehab hospital of the cape & islands hospital, the patient was noted to have vomited some heme positive material. his complete blood count showed 11% bandemia with a total white count of 10. a hida scan showed no flow, question of pancreatitis versus common bile duct obstruction. his electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm. a chest x-ray was unremarkable. during his admission to rehab hospital of the cape & islands hospital, the patient had dropped his hematocrit to the 30 s with recorded melena. he received an mrcp which was negative for evidence of stones. an ultrasound showed normal gallbladder with no wall thickening but a dilated common bile duct of 8 mm measured on ct scan. the patient had an attempted ercp on 01-18, which was unsuccessful due to a long nipple like papilla. he was therefore transferred to saints medical center for endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography. the patient 's blood cultures at outside hospital grew out streptococcus sanguis-gordonii on 01-18. this was sensitive to clindamycin, erythromycin, penicillin s and vancomycin. prior to this result, the patient had already been on ampicillin, sulbactam and gentamycin. it appears from the discharge summary that the patient was placed on unasyn 3 grams intravenously every six hours after his ercp. past medical history : 1. type 2 diabetes mellitus. 2. right rotator cuff injury. 3. gastroesophageal reflux disease with esophageal dilatation for

left as well as postoperative radiation. mr. mackey also had signs and symptoms consistent with cervical myelopathy ; a cervical mri scan showed very impressive disc herniations at c5-c6, less so at c4-c5, with clear cut cord compression, particularly on the right side c5-c6. therefore, he was admitted for c4-c5 and c5-c6 anterior diskectomy with autologous bone graft and instrumented fusion. physical examination : postoperative physical examination demonstrated that he was afebrile at 97 degrees ; blood pressure 145/80 ; pulse 60 ; respiratory rate 10 ; 100% on a non-rebreather. he was awake, alert, uncomfortable secondary to incisional tenderness at neck site as well as right iliac graft site. the wounds were clean, dry and intact, and flat. hospital course : while in the pacu, anesthesia was called because the patient became dyspneic and tachypneic and his sao2 dropped to 89%. his respiratory rate was 30 on face mask. interoperatively, he was positive two liters with a stable blood pressure and heart rate, although requiring some neo-synephrine interoperatively. he responded to intravenous lasix with 3.2 liters of urine output as well as marked clinical improvement. the etiology for his congestive heart failure was determined likely to be diastolic dysfunction from increased heart rate as well as excess volume. no definite evidence for significant myocardial ischemia, although cardiac enzymes were sent and he ruled out for myocardial infarction. he was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit where his respiratory and cardiac status was monitored carefully. he was given lasix to continue to diurese the excess volume. he was also put on lopressor 150 mg twice a day. also in the intensive care unit, o2 saturation was closely monitored. the patient became agitated with both tent and bi-pap machine, although continued to saturate well. he was transferred to medicine the morning of [**2010-08-30**], for continued medical management post surgery. on the day of transfer, the patient was noted to be confused with waxing and waning sensorium ; thus, a delirium work-up was initiated looking for precipitants. 1. when his o2 saturation was monitored, his pulse oximetry remained in the 90s during his stay. 2. his non-essential medications that may have been contributing to his change in mental status were discontinued ; those included temocillin, nortriptyline, haldol, lorazepam, venlafaxine, bupropion, and gabapentin. in addition, his cyclosporin levels were checked. 3. hypo or hyperglycemia : mahoney had been following with their

considered, although no focal deficits were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating sensorium, it was determined that there was no severe underlying structural abnormality. a head and neck ct scan, non-contrast, were ordered though to evaluate for such processes. no acute intracranial hemorrhages or midline shifts were noted, although a soft tissue mass was noted at the level of c2. this was determined to be within the normal expected changes post surgery. 6. trauma was also considered. the patient was found out of bed but no signs of head trauma, no loss of consciousness. throughout his stay, chem-10 was monitored. there were no electrolytes or mineral abnormalities that could explain his delirium. liver function tests were checked, only total bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.6. tsh was within normal limits as was b12 and folate. rpr evaluating for possible neurologic syphilis was also checked. the assay was nonreactive. an eeg was also considered to rule out

creatinine remained approximately 2.3 to 2.4 ; he has a baseline renal insufficiency. with this in mind, when obtaining a ct scan it was determined that contrast would not be the best option. while

in 1991 with cervical lymphadenopathy, was treated with mace / cytabom, and did well until 1997, when he received six cycles of fludarabine for progressive disease. in november, 2001, he progressed to leukemic phase, received rituxan and cvp. started campath in july, 2001, complicated by lymphopenia / neutropenia and cmv infection, and underwent mud stem cell transplant in december, 2002. the

with sinus symptoms, with ct scan showing left maxillary sinusitis in association with new skin nodules on right elbow and buttocks. patient was hospitalized september 26 to november 11 for what was diagnosed by skin biopsy and sinus washings as acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses, without any progression to neurologic infection ( as assessed by head ct and mri) . id consult was obtained and he was initially treated with azithromycin, itraconazole, and pentamidine, with progression of skin infection. subsequent discontinuance of azithromycin, trial of 5-fc, with increasing neutropenia requiring discontinuance, change if itraconazole to voriconazole, given continued neutropenia, and trial of sulfadiazine, discontinued for increasing ars. patient was maintained on p.o. voriconazole

new fever. workup on admission included a chest x-ray negative for pneumonia, an mri of the liver to investigate for focal lesion, with no evidence for abscess or focal lesion on report. blood and urine cultures with only positive culture a blood culture on november 20, with one of two bottles positive for coagulase negative staphylococcus. a repeat cmv hypercapture, negative for presence of cmv. a repeat cat scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of november 9, indicating progressive infection of acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis. in the days following admission, there was clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms and right thigh at foci of acanthamoeba infection, suggesting progressive skin involvement with acanthamoeba. infectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole, on which there was more existing data on treatment of acanthamoeba infection. pentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued. clinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued, with emergence on november 20 of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia, and fleeting confusion while febrile, prompting head mri which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema, with dural and, likely, leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons, concerning for early lesions of similar type. idiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis, and cyclosporine was discontinued. however, much more likely explanation is progressive infection of acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement. most likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive acanthamoeba infection, even on maximal antimicrobial therapy. a single blood culture positive for coagulase negative staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a picc line and a chest x-ray on november 20 indicating possible developing pneumonia, resulted in a course of levofloxacin, for both possible pneumonia, as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of acanthamoeba sinusitis. patient experienced steady decline, with persistent fevers despite all above measures, progressive areas of skin infection, more frequent episodes of confusion, and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion, in the setting of fluid surge spacing. on november 30, a family meeting with patient 's daughter and spouse, along with primary oncologist, dr. tomedankell bile, attending physician, dr. mellerny close, and house staff, was held to discuss patient 's critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin, sinus and neurological acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy. decision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care, with priority on patient 's comfort. pentamidine, itraconazole, levaquin, acyclovir and gcsf were discontinued, along with other medications nonessential to patient 's comfort. dnr / dni status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect. the patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger, and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion, in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays. tylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency. such measures have been continued through december 3, and patient remains comfortable through this time. this interim dictation

pneumonia. 3) renal failure requiring chronic dialysis. history of present illness : the patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from pre health on june 19, 1998 to the verg medical center intensive care unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. on may 12, 1998, the patient presented to pre health with fever, cough, dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung. she was treated with clindamycin and erythromycin which were changed to trovan and then transferred to a hospital. on may 27, 1998, the patient desaturated to 40% with a temperature of 100.5 degrees. her oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to pre health intensive care unit. chest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion. a vq scan was high probability, but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75%. on may 24, 1998, the patient had a ct scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions. at this point, a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ana was 1:640 and her rheumatoid factor and anca were negative. she was started on a steroid trial at that point. her pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy. on june 11, 1998, the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed. the patient was then started on 40 mg of prednisone q. day. from may 27, 1998 through june 19, 1998, the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8. on june 19, 1998, she

hospital course : 1) bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia : the video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. the patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay. this was changed to solu-medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems, see below. by discharge, she was returned to 40 mg of prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper. the patient 's bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course, however on july 12, 1998, after starting dialysis ( see below) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen. repeat chest x-rays and chest ct scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually, the patient 's pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks. at the time of her discharge, the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90%. 2) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura : the patient was

hospital for lower extremity angiograph ; however, that was deferred due to new onset renal failure. 1. renal failure : the patient was initially thought to be prerenal, and his renal status improved after hydration and increased oral intake. he did have a magnetic resonance angiography of his kidneys which showed mild right-sided renal artery stenosis. his renal function fluctuated throughout his hospital stay, and when he was in the medical intensive care unit he did have decreased urine output in the setting of cardiogenic shock. 2. cardiovascular : the patient with severe peripheral vascular disease. during his hospital stay, he developed some nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. he also became hypotensive on 07-02 in the setting of infection. the patient had a central line placed and went into sustained ventricular tachycardia that was treated with lidocaine. after being treated with lidocaine, the patient became apneic requiring intubation and transfer to the coronary care unit. his nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was treated with a lidocaine drip. it was found that he had elevated troponins and likely an ischemic event on the 07-02. a repeat echocardiogram showed a decreased ejection fraction from prior. he had a cardiac catheterization which revealed 3-vessel disease. cardiothoracic surgery was consulted, and due to the patient 's acute illness, they wanted to re-evaluate after the patient was extubated. the patient continued to have intermittent episodes of ventricular tachycardia. he was continued on lidocaine and eventually changed over to amiodarone. he was noted to be cardiogenic shock requiring pressors. of note, he likely suffered a second ischemic event during his coronary care unit stay. the patient did have a swan-ganz catheter in place and had a low cardiac output. the patient 's family eventually decided to withdraw care, and the patient was extubated and passed away on [**2009-07-12**]. 2. infectious disease : the patient was initially treated with levofloxacin for a left lower lobe infiltrate and a urinary tract infection. he then developed positive blood cultures with staphylococcus aureus sensitive to levofloxacin, and that was continued. when the patient became hypotensive and required intubation and pressors, his antibiotics were broadened, and he was put on stress-dose steroids. he was found to have bilateral staphylococcus pneumonia. 3. pulmonary : the patient required intubation in the setting of hypotension and ventricular tachycardia. he was actually extubated on 07-09, but then reintubated one hour

tachycardia, no antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis. baby was vigorous at delivery, was bulb suction, dried, and had free flow oxygen administered briefly. apgars were nine and nine. in the newborn nursery, he initially had a caput which increased in the amount of swelling and bruising in the subsequent 24 hours. he was then referred to the cmed ccu for assessment and management of the increased bleeding. physical examination upon admission to the cmed ccu : birth weight was 3850 grams. head circumference was 41 cm. heent was significant for swelling of the scalp tissue in generalized distribution with ecchymosis extending from the occiput to the posterior auricular area and dorsal aspect of the neck to the mid cervical level. ears were displaced forward. eyes were normal. neck and mouth were normal. no nasal flaring. chest : no retractions, good breath sounds bilaterally, no crackles. cardiovascular : regular, rate, and rhythm. femoral pulses normal, s1, s2 were normal. there was a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur in the upper left sternal border without radiation. abdomen was soft, nontender, no organomegaly, no masses. bowel sounds are active and patent. cns active, responsive to stimulation. pupils are reactive to light. tone is normal, moving all limbs symmetrically, irritable with palpation of the scalp. suck, root, gag, grasp, and morrow were normal. skin : pale as above, nonicteric. musculoskeletal : normal spine, hip, clavicles, small mass at the site of previous right quadriceps intramuscular injection. an initial head ct scan had revealed extracranial soft tissue swelling most prominently at the right frontal-parietal-occipital area extending to the left and to the upper cervical region. ventricles were symmetrical and not compressed. no gross intraparenchymal hemorrhage. but upon further radiology attending stoughton, there was a small bilateral occipital subdural hemorrhage noted. the initial hematocrit was 21.2, platelets 186. pt was 14.6, ptt 77 with an inr of 1.4. fibrinogen was 192. d-dimer was negative. assessment : this is a term infant with significant subgaleal hematoma with apparent extension over the past six

coumadin dosing. this was postoperative day # 6, at which time she is ready for discharge. the rest of her hospital course was unremarkable, with perioperative ampicillin, gentamicin and flagyl discontinued on postoperative day # 1. she had some initial nausea but had no emesis. her nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day # 1, and she tolerated a regular diet by postoperative day # 3. she had flatus and regular bowel movements by postoperative day # 5. she also complained of some slight dizziness upon getting up. for this reason, her normal lopressor and norvasc were held. it was felt that this was re-equalibration after being sedentary and mostly in bed following the operation. she had some slight headaches which resolved with tylenol, and the dizziness resolved as well. she was ready for discharge on postoperative day # 6. her wound remained benign and was healing nicely at the time of discharge. discharge medications : lopressor 50 mg q.a.m, 25 mg q.p.m, and 25 mg q.h.s, synthroid 88 mcg q.d, norvasc 5 mg q.d, lescol 20 mg q.p.m. with meal, coumadin is usually 4 mg p.o. 3x a week and 3 mg 4x a week ; percocet 1-2 tabs q.4h. p.r.n. pain. discharge

hemorrhage / pneumonia, hyperglycemia, renal insufficiency, hyperuricemia, hypophosphatemia. history of present illness : this 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least november 1993, while he was living in aersing rocuch sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions, and low dose hydroxyurea. apparently, a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. he came to this country in late december 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up. he had been noting night sweats, increasing fatigue, anorexia, and dyspnea, which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea. he became profoundly thrombocytopenic, and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness. past medical history : significant for chronic atrial fibrillation, managed with an italian variation of digoxin, and amioadrone, hypertension managed with an ace inhibitor, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids, as well as an occasional inhaler. other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology, for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol. he also had a penetrating injury to the right eye, which had rendered him blind 10 years previously. physical examination : he was a chronically ill appearing elderly man, with a respiratory rate of 30, temperature 99.6, pulse 100, and irregularly irregular, blood pressure 148/71. he had some petechiae on his extremities, as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae. there were bibasilar rales with some wheezing. he had no cardiac murmur. his abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly, which was somewhat tender. the neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable. laboratory data : included a white blood count of 140,000, 7% polys, 1% bands, 3% lymphs, 1% monos, 2 basos, 4 blasts, 76% pearl monocytes, 6% meta 's, 3 nucleated red blood cells. there were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes. the platelet count was 9,000, hematocrit was 26.5, with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73. his prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal. his uric acid was up at 97, his total bilirubin was up at 1.8, his ldh was 428, his phosphorus was 1.2, calcium 8.6, digoxin level was 1.0, potassium on admission was 2.9, sodium 135, bun and creatinine 13/1.6, and sugar of 267. a computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed, a chest x-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses. there was cardiomegaly with

hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding, while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia. transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count, presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen. amicar was of uncertain value, but used intermittently. a bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his cmml to acute myelogenous leukemia, and given his other underlying medical problems, we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous cystosine arabinoside and 6-thioguanine, which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000, and his spleen shrank noticeably, but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions. he was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid, for his hydrea, although we kept him on allopurinol. the renal function deteriorated somewhat, hampering our ability to give him his gentamicin. the family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days

were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes. on 10-27-93, the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions, a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been ptca 'd, a lesion in the first om, and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the om3. the left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle. given the results of this cardiac catheterization, which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the ptca, it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient. he was ambulated progressively on the floor. a beta blocker was started with metoprolol initially at 25 mg po bid and eventually increased to 50 mg po bid. the patient ambulated extensively on the fih 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath. on 11-2-93, the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with thallium imaging. this treadmill test was done on medications, including beta blockers, in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment. the patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified bruce protocol, however, he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade. there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test, although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm st depression in ii, iii, and avf. the study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain. thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle. there was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test. these images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous thallium images in may 1993. after extensive discussion between myself, dr. amesin, and dr. scgach, it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management. the patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery, although he understands that this may become necessary in the future. dr. amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance. previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments. the importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient. she will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with dr. amesin as well as dr. lfsquarc on the outside. the patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization. despite being on heparin for a short time, his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done. he will need to be followed up as an out

egd on 11/17/04. this responded to fluid bolus. the patient was then transferred to medicine team d given her tenuous hemodynamic status. the patient, several days later 11/23, underwent another dobutamine stress test. this stress test, although complicated by hypotension again, to the 60 's or 70 's was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning, but no evidence of ischemia and an ef from this test was 76%. clearly, the patient 's hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine. 2. infectious disease : on hospital day #2, the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion. the next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential uti. she continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day, 11/17/04, her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates. she was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin. her urine legionella antigen was negative. on 11/22/04, she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum. she was started on vancomycin for this. these bacteria turned out to be mrsa and she was continued on her vancomycin. she had picc line placed on the day prior to

while she was in the endoscopy suite, as mentioned above, she had a hypotensive episode, which responded to some fluid boluses. finally, on the day prior to discharge, she was stabilized to the point that she could have her egd. the egd did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis. her stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals, sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus. 4. shortness of breath : as mentioned above, the patient did develop mrsa pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge. at most, her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge, she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula. this was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however, with her right ventricular hypokinesis, it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient, for example, with chest ct.

death : cardiogenic shock. causative factors : including cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, status post aortic valve replacement, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. history of present illness : the patient is a 65 year old male who sustained a small myocardial infarction first in 1978, with course thereafter including a coronary artery bypass graft by dr. wierst at noughwell entanbon health in 1986. in 1991 he presented with congestive heart failure and he underwent porcine aortic valve replacement. in the seven to eight months preceding admission, he developed recurrent angina with dyspnea on exertion. the patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization in early december, 1993. past medical history : significant for vertebrobasilar insufficiency, bipolar mood disorder, and hypercholesterolemia, as well as some baseline renal insufficiency. medications on admission : procardia sustained release 60 mg. po q.day, digoxin .25 mg. po q.day, lasix 30 mg. ( interval unspecified) , prozac 40 mg. po q.day, lovestatin 20 mg. po bid, aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium. physical examination : remarkable for an oriented, alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis. his pulse exam was intact. cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest, with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index. there was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient, native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex, dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip. a patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted, and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present. also of note, pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with lasix, morphine, oxygen and nitroglycerin. post-procedure he was admitted to the ccu because of the history of left main dissection. he remained hemodynamically stable but of note, would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe. transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis. the next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by psychiatry and treated with ativan. the patient was then evaluated by cardiac surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting. in the course of preoperative workup, mr. has was evaluated completely by psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on prozac, underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology, possibly microvascular infarct, acute paranoid and belligerent behavior, possibly due to medications. on december 12 the patient underwent surgery, including", "qas": [{"question": "does he

with stable hemodynamics on lidocaine at one, dobutamine at 200 and nipride. the patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement. chest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema. aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded, albeit sluggishly. in addition, he remained agitated. this was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with haldol appropriately. on day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the lasix/ mannitol infusion. his urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour. despite this, his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated. he required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with nipride which was changed to hydralazine to avoid shunting. he received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure. very early in the morning on postoperative day # 3, the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated, without complication. with positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis, his arterial blood gases improved. throughout this he remained hemodynamically stable. exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and lidocaine. his chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum. infectious disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with vancomycin, ceftazidime and gentamicin. cardiology evaluation commented on the patient 's increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an r and t phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged qt interval. consequently his pronestyl was discontinued. in addition, the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2. on the evening of the 18th, the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable, although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal. on 60% fio2 his po2 was 63. it was increased to 65% with po2 of 81. at approximately 7:50 a.m, house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations. the patient was immediately given 400 mg. of calcium chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated. within one minute, the patient lost his blood pressure and cpr was initiated and code was called. the patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with emv and he was bolused with levophed and given some volume while compressions continued. the patient 's prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained. the chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade. compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion. the patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked, initially without response but after several doses of epinephine, one-half mg. of atropine and a bolus of lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly, and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation. further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the

the patient was admitted and placed in isolation on neutropenic precautions. he was transfused with 1/2 units of packed red blood cells and given lasix periodically to prevent him from going into congestive heart failure has he had on his prior transfusion. because his need for multiple transfusionsm he was transfused with radiated leuco four units. the patient had a good bump in his hematocrit, more than expected from 22 to high 20 's range next day after 3 1/2 units, but later that evening had a drop in his hematocrit so was given 4 more 1/2 units at this point for a total of 4 units packed red blood cells. he again did not bump his hematocrit sufficiently and remained in the high 20 's after a total of 4 units, so he was given 2 more total units in 1/2 units segments the following day. his hematocrit subsequently bumped to greater than 30 and was discharged with hematocrit of 32 on 11-7-93. the patient remained asymptomatic from a chf stand point and felt much better after the transfusions. it is unclear why the patient did not bump his hematocrit more but he did not appear to be hemolyzing from laboratory data, that is his ldh was within normal limits. in addition, multiple stools were guaiaced and were all guaiac negative. the patient was discharged with follow-up with his hematologist, dr. eci area and rheumatologist, dr. taange peter, and cardiologist, dr. peter. medications on discharge : prednisone 10 mg po q day, verapamil 80 mg po t.i.d, digoxin 0.25 mg po q day, isordil 20 mg po t.i.d, theo-dur 200 mg po b.i.d, lasix 80mg q am, 40

10, 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy, as well as rigid bronchoscopy. she then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial, and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy. the pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration. she remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the respiratory intensive care unit. the patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included vancomycin, ceftazidime and gentamicin. on postoperative day two, she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing. the patient was seen in consultation by the neurology service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking. an endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis. she received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet. the patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator. a repeat echocardiogram on february 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on february 11, which showed only a small pericardial effusion. a pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on february 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess. she remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics. her chest x-ray showed bilateral air space disease, consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome. she suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity. her steroids were weaned. because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean, on february 24, 1994, she had a tracheostomy placed. she remained in a coma. the blood cultures on february 26, 1994 grew out staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia. her sputum grew out pseudomonas aeruginosa as well. the urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin. on march 3, 1994, a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections. there was a large left pleural effusion however. this was drained with a left chest tube. her sputum then grew out klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem. she developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed. on march 13, 1994, she regained some level of consciousness. she was able to fix and follow with her eyes, respond to commands. on march 14, 1994, her right lung was pleurodesed. attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and fentanyl. this was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean. she continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's. she also fell into a coma once again. on march 31, 1994, her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes. on april 2, 1994, she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole, which responded only to manual ventilation. discussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery. she had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of jose pineston, as well as in discussions with her loved ones. decision was made in conjunction with the family and dr. caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support. the patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a t-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics. her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on april 2,

main coronary artery, 90% stenosis of the lad, 80% stenosis of the circumflex, 90% stenosis of om2 and a proximally occluded right coronary artery. after reviewing cardiac catheterization data, a consultation was made with cardiothoracic surgery who deemed that he was a good candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting. over the ensuing days, mr. nina chf was managed by the ccu team and he received treatment for what was now determined to be a klebsiella pneumonia. he was treated with a full course of zosyn. on [**2014-03-11**], mr. knueppel went to the operating room with dr. streeter. he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft of four vessels. he had a saphenous vein graft to his lad and diagonal in a sequential fashion, saphenous vein graft to his pda and a saphenous vein graft to his om. the procedure was performed by dr. streeter and assisted by dr. . the patient tolerated the procedure well without complication and was transferred to the cardiac surgery recovery unit without complication. please see the previously dictated operative note for more details. mr. knueppel had a long postoperative course. his postoperative course was complicated by hypertension which was managed medically. during his postoperative course, he did not suffer from any arrhythmias nor did he have any episode of hypotension. at the time of discharge, he was on a stable antihypertensive regimen appropriate for someone with a decreased ejection fraction. mr. knueppel had had a long protracted period of intubation prior to the operation. the status of mr. nina pulmonary system necessitated a prolonged postoperative intubation. after a very slow wean from ventilatory support, mr. knueppel was successfully extubated on postoperative day number nine. he continued to be very tenuous from a pulmonary point of view and required frequent chest pt. for this reason, mr. knueppel was kept in the intensive care unit where very close monitoring could be performed. in addition, he had chest pt performed at very regular intervals by the icu staff. his pulmonary status was so tenuous that we were unable to transfer him to the regular patient care floor during his hospitalization. mr. knueppel had an emergent cricothyroidotomy followed by a formal tracheostomy at the outside hospital. there is much scarring surrounding his larynx. such a situation frequently makes it very difficult to swallow without aspirating. as is expected, mr. knueppel failed a swallowing study early on in his boston regional medical centerr hospital course. the study was repeated and yet again mr. knueppel was unable to swallow without evidence of aspiration. after a prolonged period of being fed via nasogastric tube, mr. knueppel finally had a formal percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed in the intensive care unit. this was performed on [**2014-04-01**], postoperative day number 21. this procedure was performed by dr. kevin taussig and assisted by dr. carla solan. the

lesser sac collection. gallbladder was visualized with stones. in summary, the patient was considered to have severe necrotizing pancreatitis, with severe cardiac disease. hospital course : the patient was admitted, placed on intravenous fluids. he was continued on his imipenem, intravenously. the patient was started on total parenteral nutrition. on 4/17/95, gi interventional radiology performed drainage of the peripancreatic fluid collection. approximately one liter of brownish fluid was obtained and sent for culture. the drainage catheter was left in a pseudocyst. the patient was evaluated by cardiology. a persantine thallium study demonstrated a large infarct, involving the posteroseptal, anteroseptal areas. left ventricular aneurysm was also noted ; however, no ischemia was seen. an echocardiogram was done. the echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function, with left ventricular aneurysm. the right ventricle appeared to be acceptable. the percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output. the fluid was sent for amylase, which came back 53,230. on 4/28/95, the patient had new onset of abdominal pain. his white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5, on 4/27. a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed. approximately 100 cc.'s of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter. the computerized tomography scan showed the catheter tip in good position. because of the patient 's deteriorating state, the patient was brought to the operating room on 4/28/95. an exploratory laparotomy was performed. the splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface. thus, the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected. the patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy, and oversewing of the descending colon. drainage of the pancreatic necrosis was also done. the patient tolerated the procedure fairly well, and was transferred to the intensive care unit. in the intensive care unit, the patient had a prolonged course. the patient was then extubated on postoperative day #2, but remained pressor-dependent. he remained on imipenem, and vancomycin was also started. thereafter, the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course. he was eventually transferred to the floor, where he remained meta-stable. he had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic. these resolved without incident. he also had repeated temperature spikes. after repeated work ups, it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area. his drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced, and eventually discontinued. mr. mass was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics. most recently, he was on a 28 day course of vancomycin, ofloxacin, and flagyl, for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric

present illness : mrs. gonzalez is a patient with a prior medical history including hypothyroidism, iron-deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, increased cholesterol, peptic ulcer disease, chronic constipation, and status post appendectomy as well as status post hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. she was transferred from an outside hospital for evaluation and treatment of adenocarcinoma involving the transverse colon and gallbladder. at the outside hospital the patient had already seemed some workup for a couple weeks duration of bilateral upper quadrant pain which occasionally radiated to her back. she was also complaining of fatigue for two weeks but a good appetite and the patient denied weight loss, melena, or bright red blood per rectum. a cat scan of the abdomen showed air-fluid levels in the gallbladder. it also showed a thickened gallbladder wall as well as a dilated common bile duct. incidentally, it also showed diverticulosis. a hida scan at the other hospital did not show filling of the gallbladder indicating some sort of cystic duct obstruction. the first imaging study that was done at hahnemann general hospital was a mrcp which revealed an enhanced thickened gallbladder wall consistent with chronic cholecystitis. a differential according to the imaging included a fistula with adjacent inflammatory change but also carcinoma or adenomatosis. in addition, also the mrcp showed a mass near the region of the neck of the gallbladder. of note, at the outside hospital, an endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed. the colonoscopy showed two polyps and also a region in the transverse colon that was biopsied. this biopsy came back as positive for adenocarcinoma. the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was already established prior to her admission at this hospital. hospital course : the patient was scheduled for an operative date on [**2014-07-29**] and over the next few days she was given a low-residual diet. she had her belly cleaned with hibiclens one a day and once an adequate preoperative evaluation was performed, she was given a bowel prep on monday afternoon and evening in preparation for an exploratory laparotomy on tuesday, [**2014-07-29**]. on the morning of [**2014-07-29**], the patient was taken to the operating room and underwent a cholecystectomy, partial hepatectomy, partial lymph node dissection, a colocolostomy, partial colectomy, and in addition a gastrostomy and a feeding jejunostomy were also put in place. please refer to the previously dictated operative notes for the details of this surgery. briefly, the surgery on [**2014-07-29**] revealed a carcinoma of the gallbladder with a cholecystocolonic fistula which crossed into the liver as well as metastatic adenopathy around the portal nodes as well as retroperitoneal nodes around the inferior vena cava and the hepatic artery. in addition to the gastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy tube, two belmont-gardner drains were placed.

present illness : jadiara harrison is twin #1 born to a 17 year-old primiparous mother at 31 weeks gestation. mother was admitted to the nantucket cottage hospital from lawrence general hospital hospital on 05-01 with cervical effacement and preterm labor. she was treated with magnesium sulfate. she had previously been admitted here at the 24th week after a motor vehicle accident. she was treated with tocolysis and betamethasone at that time. due to progressing labor and presentation of twins, delivery was by cesarean section. prenatal screens were notable for blood type 0 positive, antibody negative, hepatitis b surface antigen negative, rpr nonreactive. rubella status was not documented. group b strep status was unknown. infant emerged from the breech position. she was vigorous. she was given blow-by oxygen and stimulation. her apgars were 7 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. she was brought to the cmed csru for further evaluation. physical examination : on admission, physical examination reveals a non dysmorphic infant, well saturated and perfused with multiple bruises noted over the upper legs, left arm and chest. no bony abnormalities or petechiae noted. she was moving all joints and extremities well. heent : within normal limits. cv : normal s1 and s2 without a murmur. lungs were clear. abdomen was benign. genitalia normal. premature female. neuro : non focal and age appropriate. hips normal, held in the breech position. anus patent. spine intact. hospital course : respiratory : on admission, infant did not require supplemental oxygen or respiratory support. since that time, jadiara has always been in room air without requiring supplemental oxygen. she was noted to have apnea of prematurity, treated with caffeine until [**2017-06-04**]. since that time, she has had very rare spells, with none for over one week by the time of discharge. cardiovascular : she was hemodynamically stable upon admission with normal blood pressures and heart rate. on day of life 15, she was noted to have a murmur, eventually prompting evaluation by echo. the echo revealed an anomalous left coronary, with one end entering the right ventricular outflow tract and the other end not clearly defined. it was unable to be delineated whether this represented an anomalous left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery ( lcapa) or a left coronary artery fistula to the pulmonar artery. the right coronary was prominent, and there appeared to be coronary artery collateral vessels in the posterior apical myocardium. a small apical muscular vsd was also noted. several additional echos were performed, including an echo in the cardiology department at healthsouth rehab hospital of western mass, but the anatomy of the left coronary artery could not be further defined. due to the risks of coronary ischemia if this represented an lcapa, the infant was followed with regular echos and ekgs during the remainder of hospitalization, with no evidence of ischemia, valvular regurgitation, or compromised", "qas": [{"question": "does the patient have any preterm labor", "id": "0253_0_0", "answers": [{"answer_id": "0253_0_0_0", "text": "mother was

nstemi. . hospital course by system :. * cv : the patient 's family refused coronary artery catheterization. the patient was given asa, plavix, heparin drip x 24 hours, nitro drip, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril. her chest pain was controlled with morphine. her sbp remained in the 160s-170s on hospital day 1 and she was gently diuresed. on hospital day 2 she experienced atrial fibrillation with hr in the 140s. her metoprolol dose was increased from 25 mg po bid to 50 mg po bid then 75 mg po tid. her hr decreased to 70s-80s. her bp remained stable. an echo showed that she had preserved ef and no wall motion abnormalities. we decided given her age that she would not be a good candidate for cardioversion for her afib nor would she be a good candidate for coumadin. therefore we will continue rate control with metoprolol this can be titrated if needed, and aspirin and plavix for anti-coagulation. she should also continue on lipitor and lisinopril. she should have her chem 7 checked next week given the start of her new meds. will also need lft 's checked in 3-6 months. . * pulmonary : bilateral crackles at bases and midlungs, elevated jvp, trace bilateral ankle edema, and cxr with diffuse opacities suggest possible pulmonary edema, likely secondary to acute mi. her o2 sat was stable at 94-97% on 2.5l of supplemental o2. she experienced no respiratory difficulty during the hospital stay. she was diuresed small amount. her cxr prior to discharge showed mild pulm edema and thus was given 40 of lasix prior to going to rehab. she can be given prn lasix for weight gain or shortness of breath. . * leukocytosis- she developed mild elevated wbc. ua had 12-14 wbc 's, few bacteria. she was initially started on bactrim, but this was stopped as she was afebrile. she has a culture pending which needs to be followed up at the nursing home and treated if positive. . * code : dnr/dni medications on admission : tylenol prn lisinopril 5 mg po qd protonix

process. the differential diagnosis of this is wide including viral, fungal and atypical mycobacterial infections. drug toxicity would be a consideration, although somewhat less likely given the unilaterality of the findings. 4. new jejunal wall thickening with persistent distal ileal wall thickening and diffuse mesenteric stranding, most likely reflecting an infectious etiology. 5. overall stability in metastatic burden. 4) echo ( 06-18 ): mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved biventricular systolic function. mild posterior mitral valve prolapse with mild mitral

opacities, suggestive of an underlying infectious process. echo was done and confirmed normal ejection fraction. his respiratory status improved slowly, oxygen was weaned off, and he was discharged on course of levaquin. 2) metastatic rcc : sutent was held on admission in light of acute infection. he underwent a staging ct scan torso which suggested no significant increase in tumor burden. patient was also found to have abnormal tfts on sutent and was started on replacement therapy. he will need follow-up bloodwork as an outpatient. recent ct scan showed destruction of l femoral neck. he underwent an xray of the l femur which did not suggest an acute fracture. no limitations were placed in regards to weightbearing status. patient was instructed to restart sutent next monday. 3) renal

postoperative day three, the patient had an episode of shortness of breath that was evaluated by both the renal and surgical residents. it was found that she was in acute pulmonary edema and required

her beta blocker was progressively increased, and her nitroglycerin drip was weaned down. two days after this event, she underwent an echocardiogram which was significant for slightly depressed left

systolic blood pressure. however, subsequent it was determined that the patient 's hypotension may have been related to his rapid ventricular response and right heart failure. therefore the focus of treatment was changed to controlling his rate. 2. atrial fibrillation - the patient 's digoxin had been weaned off prior to his admission. it was felt that this potentially had lead to his atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. the patient was loaded once again with digoxin and his beta blocker was increased to 100 mg of lopressor, three times a day. in addition the patient was started on verapamil since his heart rate had remained mildly tachycardiac in the low 100s. 3. congestive heart failure - during the initial course of the patient 's admission, it was unclear as to whether or not he was volume overloaded or volume depleted. the patient was initially treated with intravenous fluids, however, subsequently he was diuresed when he became symptomatic and short of breath. chest x-rays revealed evidence of congestive heart failure. the decision was made to have the patient undergo a cardiac catheterization to fully evaluate the hemodynamics to determine the etiology of the patient 's heart failure. in addition, plans were made to evaluate the patient 's cardiac arteries to determine if he had any component of ischemic cardiomyopathy. 4. abnormal liver function tests - the patient had an isolated, elevated alkaline phosphatase with a confirmatory elevation in his gamma glutamyl transferase. an ultrasound of the right upper quadrant did not reveal any cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, however, an irregular hepatic contour was seen which is suggestive of underlying chronic liver disease. there was some concern that the patient may have a partial biliary obstruction and the patient was sent for an magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to further evaluate the biliary system. magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not reveal any evidence of biliary dilatation or of any obstructing pancreatic mass. again seen was a slightly irregular contour of the liver with dilated hepatic veins suggesting chronic hepatic vascular congestion. the patient also revealed a prior history of heavy alcohol use for approximately 20 years, during the mid 1950s to mid 1970s. it was felt that he may have had some component of vascular congestion from his congestive heart failure as well as possibly some mild cirrhotic changes secondary to his previous alcohol use. 5. fall - the patient had a mechanical fall during his admission. he did not sleep at all the night before and was extremely fatigued. he was walking in the hall, dragging his intravenous pole when he tripped over the foot of the pole and lost his balance. he fell backwards, landing on his buttocks and bumped his head. his neurological examination at that time was nonfocal and the head was atraumatic without any evidence of a hematoma. a computerized axial tomography scan of his head at that time did not reveal any extra or intracranial hemorrhage. 6. rectal bleeding - the patient has a history of rectal bleeding, ever since his brachytherapy for his prostate cancer. the patient has been treated with argon laser therapy in the past for his rectal bleeding and it is recommended that he follow up with his

difficult weaning her off of neo-synephrine. she was also given stress dose steroids. later in her hospital course she also had an echocardiogram for question of new ecg findings in her inferior leads. her echocardiogram, however, was essentially normal with an ejection fraction of 55% without any gross wall motion abnormalities or valvular pathology. as mentioned above the patient 's hemodynamic status was tenuous throughout her hospital course as it was difficult to wean the patient off of neo-synephrine. by 06-28, however, the patient had been off of neo-synephrine, but at this time as mentioned above the patient was deemed to be cmo per discussion with physicians and her husband / health care proxy. 3. hematology : patient with a history of known malignancy and also a

negative for pcp and subsequently was continued and clindamycin was changed for anaerobic coverage. in addition her vancomycin and levaquin were also discontinued. the patient remained afebrile during the majority of her hospital course. by virtue of discussions on 06-28 the patient was deemed to be cmo and all antibiotics were withdrawn at this point. 5. gastroenterology : the patient had an abdominal ct earlier in her intensive care unit course, which was essentially negative for an intraabdominal pathology. she was initially supported with tube feeds during her intensive care unit course, but at this point the patient is cmo and tube feeds have been subsequently discontinued. disposition : the patient 's attending physician was in constant communication with the patient 's health care proxy her husband. as her intensive care unit course continued and the patient showed minimal signs of meaningful improvement, continued discussions were had with the family about possibly changing code status. ultimately it was decided by 06-28 that the patient had shown minimal improvement and minimal evidence of improvement status, it was decided at this point for the patient to be extubated and to move toward cmo care. subsequently all antibiotics, blood draws and supportive blood pressure medications were withdrawn. currently she is comfortable with morphine and ativan prn.

have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy. it was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process, but this was not clarified during this admission. it was not felt likely to be due to parkinson 's disease, as he had no significant response to eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor, although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic. he had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on october 18, 1996. this showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct, but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old

apparently, she had done well until the 24 hours proceeding admission when the cellulitis was felt to be worsening. she had also been noted to be confused and combative during that 24 hour period. as her baseline mental status is completely alert and oriented, this caused concern amongst the staff of the rehabilitation center and the patient was transferred to the retelk county medical center.

pitched murmur peaking at mid to late systole and heard across the precordium. it radiates to both carotids bilaterally. there was also a blowing holosystolic murmur heard at the patient 's apex to axilla. there was no s3 appreciated. vascular examination was notable for 1+ carotid impulses which were diminished and delayed and the above mentioned transmitted cardiac murmurs. abdominal examination revealed that the abdomen was soft, non-tender, non-distended, no organomegaly, no masses, normal active bowel sounds. the patient 's extremity examination was notable for erythema of the right calf with a small ulcer with a relatively clean base. neurological examination revealed that the patient was quite sedated at this time having received some medications. she was arousable only to painful stimuli. her pupils were reactive bilaterally. her face was symmetric. she had an intact gag reflex. she was able to move all four of her extremities in response to pain. her deep tendon

on admission to the emergency room, the patient was somewhat argumentative and confused as well as uncooperative with procedures. a neurologic work-up was undertaken which included a ct scan of the head which revealed no acute bleed and a lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 72, protein 65, white blood cell count 19, red blood cell count 11,500 with no evidence of xanthrochromasia. the neurology service evaluated the patient who felt that her agitation was most likely due to infection, her multiple medications, or her metabolic condition. the patient 's mental status slowly began to recover, however on the morning of the first day of admission, august 16, 1998, the patient was found after having fallen. a neurological examination was performed which revealed no abnormality and

to shriner 's hospital for crippled children for increased blood pressure and proteinuria. she was transferred to charles river hospital and was treated with magnesium sulfate and betamethasone. the morning of admission the mother developed vaginal bleeding and fetal bradycardia was noted. therefore, a stat cesarean section was performed. the infant emerged limp and without spontaneous respiratory effort. he was given bag mask ventilation with good response. apgar scores were 6 at one minute and 8 at five minutes. prenatal screens : o+, hepatitis b surface antigen negative, rpr nonreactive, rubella immune. admission physical examination : the birth weight was 1,770 grams. the patient was in mild to moderate respiratory distress. he was a nondysmorphic male. anterior fontanel was soft, open and flat. the ears and eyes were normally placed. the palate was intact. the oropharynx was benign. neck was supple without masses or defects. the lungs were coarse bilaterally with moderate retractions. the cardiovascular examination revealed s1 and s2 regular, no murmurs, 2+ femoral pulses. he was warm and well perfused. the abdomen was benign, flat, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly. he had a normal male phallus and bilaterally descended testes. the anus was patent and normally placed. hips were stable without clunk. the extremities were normal in appearance. the skin was without lesions. the neurological examination was appropriate for age with normal tone and strength and appropriate reflexes. hospital course : 1. cardiovascular : the patient remained cardiovascularly stable throughout the admission. he was noted to have some apnea and bradycardic spells of prematurity and was therefore started on caffeine. with the initiation of caffeine therapy

esophagus filled with clots and small amount of bleeding varices, clot in the stomach with antral gastritis, and a normal duodenum. she was started on pitressin, a blakemore tube was inserted. she was transferred to the ph university of medical center intensive care unit where on january 25 in the morning her hematocrit was found to be 27.4. she was transfused another 2 units of packed red blood cells over the course of the day and her hematocrit improved to 29.4 and then 31.2. the gi service was consulted and an upper endoscopy study showed grade iii varices with no active bleeding and a clean base gastric ulcer possibly secondary to the blakemore tube. her varices had stigmata of recent bleeding, were banded successfully. after the procedure and 2 more units of packed red blood cells, the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit was stable at 31.2. at that time she was transferred from the intensive care unit to coden 2 for the lemgarson hospital service. past

unchanged from the previous examination. again, his intracranial pressure and neurologic examination remained the same, and conservative treatment was opted for. 2. cardiovascular : as described in previous section, neo-synephrine and eventually levophed were used to maintain a coronary perfusion pressure of greater than 70. a pulmonary artery catheter was placed on hospital day four. this catheter was placed when the patient started to demonstrate septic physiology and for increasing pressor support. please see infectious disease section for more details. 3. gastrointestinal : mr. roach was n.p.o. from the time of his admission. a orogastric tube was passed. initially during admission, carafate was given down the orogastric tube. however, on a routine chest x-ray shot on hospital day three, a mediastinum was noted. this raised the question of potential esophageal rupture. gastroenterology was consulted for this. gastroenterology was consulted to assist in creating the most appropriate diagnostic rhythm given his intubated and sedated status. at this point, his carafate was switched to intravenous protonix and he was strictly n.p.o. 4. hematology : throughout mr. richard admission, his hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s. as will be discussed in the infectious disease section, he developed an episode of what appeared to be sepsis, and his white blood cell count peaked at 23. mr. roach was on pneumo boots spontaneous compression devices for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. he was not a candidate for subcutaneous heparin as we were concerned of an intracranial hemorrhage. an inferior vena cava filter was considered but was deferred, as it was felt that mr. roach was too unstable to undergo the procedure. 5. endocrine : mr. marian blood sugar was maintained under tight control from 100 to 130 using a regular insulin sliding-scale. 6. infectious disease : mr. roach had a spike in white blood cell count and developed fevers. his blood urine and sputum were all cultured. blood cultures were pertinent for one bottle of gram - positive coagulase - negative staphylococcus which grew from 08-25. his preliminary cultures including sputum from 08-25 grew escherichia coli. sputum from 08-27 grew gram-negative rods, not yet speciated, and from 08-27 a bronchoalveolar lavage grew 1+ gram-negative rods and 4+ polymorphonuclear lymphocytes. throughout this time, mr. richard temperature continued to increase and was such that on hospital day four, his temperature maximum was 42.2 degrees centigrade. during his hospitalization, his was

roach developed a pneumonia likely from gram-negative organisms, but most likely from escherichia coli. for this pneumonia, he was placed empirically on imipenem, vancomycin, and flagyl. on hospital day three, mr. roach had developed an episode of tachycardia and tachypnea. for this, a ct angiogram was obtained which demonstrated no pulmonary embolism. on hospital day four, a routine chest x-ray revealed a left-sided pneumothorax. for this, a left #34 caucasian chest tube was placed. on the evening of hospital day four, mr. roach had an acute episode whereby his central venous pressure rose sharply and immediately followed by a period of asystole. urgent resuscitation measures were initiated. the measures included attempts at pacing. epinephrine and atropine were administered as were bicarbonate and calcium. he had a differential diagnosis of asystole preceded by an acute rise in central venous pressure included attention pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, and pulmonary embolism. during the resuscitation afterwards, it was noted that a patent left chest tube was present in the left chest, so initially neo-decompression was attempted in the right chest. there was no sign of attention pneumothorax with decompression, and a right chest tube was placed. during this time, a needle aspiration of what was felt to be the pericardium was performed revealing bloody fluid coming back. a left anterior thoracotomy was made by the cardiac surgery fellow who was present. after 30 minutes of active resuscitation including internal cardiac massage, there was no evidence of return of vital signs or electric activity to the heart as noted on electrocardiogram monitors. resuscitation was terminated at 1914 on 08-27. after the termination of resuscitation, both the anesthesia

with a-line and nipride intravenously. it was finally under control with high doses of captopril, nifedipine, and hydrochlorothiazide. the workup to rule out secondary cause of hypertension given the patient 's young age and the difficulty controlling the blood pressure was started as an inpatient and will be completed by dr. as an outpatient. so far no secondary causes of hypertension were identified but causes like lymphocytic? chromocytoma or renal artery stenosis have not been ruled out yet. medications on discharge : hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. po q.day, captopril 75 mg. po three

pneumonia, developed adult respiratory distress syndrome, and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support. mr. breutzfarstxei was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on 01/17/91. he was admitted to the retelk county medical center at that time and was treated with bactrim and steroids. he was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study. he initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of bactrim and a steroid taper. at discharge after about two weeks post-extubation, he had an o2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air. he was seen by dr. seen and dr. seen as an out-patient. on 02/06/91, he was seen in flfdmc and at that point, his temperature was noted to be 101.4 and he had malaise and diarrhea. he was evaluated in the emergency room. at that time, his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest x-ray showed no change. cultures were taken and he was sent out. on 02/08/91, the patient called dr. seen because of increased shortness of breath and malaise. he was seen in flfdmc where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge. review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway. his oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted. past medical history : 1) hiv positive with a cd4 count of 74. 2) recent pcp. 3) status post right elbow surgery. 4) venereal disease history. 5) ppd anergic. the patient 's hiv risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse, prostitution, and a former prisoner. physical examination : on presentation, the patient was a young appearing hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140/90, heart rate 120, respirations 32, and temperature 101. skin : jaundiced. heent : revealed icteric sclerae, the oropharynx with extensive thrush, and an ulcer under his tongue. neck : he had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple. lungs : had tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung fields. cardiac : showed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. there was no costovertebral angle tenderness. abdomen : soft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness. his liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin. his spleen was not palpable.

patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both. in terms of pulmonary function, it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a bactrim failure for pcp although this was unusual. he was started on pentamidine, especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to bactrim. the patient was also covered with erythromycin and gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods. he was given supplemental oxygen. in terms of his liver abnormalities, it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities. titers for cmv and epstein-barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent. stool was sent for ova and parasites. gastrointestinal was consulted. initially, the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen. however, on 02/10/91, his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased. actually in reviewing the records at this point, it appears that pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of erythromycin and gentamicin, the patient 's respiratory status worsened and his ldh climbed so he began pentamidine on 02/10/91. on 02/11/91, the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen, dropped his o2 saturations, and was intubated on 02/11/91. he was transferred to the intensive care unit on 12/12/90 on gentamicin, vancomycin, pentamidine, and prednisone. also of note at that point, hepatitis c virus serologies had come back positive. however, at this point, his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1. the patient 's abdominal ct scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction. the patient 's liver function tests appeared to improve. the patient 's penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on acyclovir. on 02/13/91, the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted. no other cultures grew out and the patient 's clinical

consult was obtained and subsequent radiographic imaging revealed chronic appearing infarcts in the right occipital lobe as well as both cerebellar hemispheres, suggestive of more chronic infarcts, as

he has no distinctive psychiatric disorder, except for perhaps postoperative delirium. cardiovascularly, the patient did extremely well following the surgery. the levophed drip was continued until postoperative day number one. milrinone was continued until postoperative day number three, at which point he was having good enough cardiac output that he did not need these drips to help maintain his blood pressure anymore. he has remained without any chest pain following this procedure and his sternal wound is clean, dry and intact at the end of the procedure. in addition, he has

to the persistent fevers, the patient underwent vancomycin desensitization in the surgical intensive care unit followed by a change of antibiotics to vancomycin and levofloxacin. further cultures from sputum and urine revealed yeast sensitive to diflucan, which was administered shortly after. because of expected long term antibiotic administration, a picc line was placed and the patient was prepared for transfer back to fo hospital. as a small complication, the patient opened a left ankle wound post saphenous vein harvest, which persists up until now and is of a size 2 x 1 cm. due to

insufficient cells were obtained to proceed. he was returned previous to this admission for repeat bone marrow harvest and at that time he was given neupogen prior to his harvest, and sufficient cells were not obtained to proceed with autologous bone marrow transplantation. his most recent bone marrow biopsy revealed less than 5% of intratrabecular space involvement. recent ct scan showed no significant lymphadenopathy. the spleen was within normal limits. past medical history : 1. episode of pneumonia in 1996. 2. at the age of 40 he had problems with frequent headaches. 3. episodes of

total body irradiation of 1400 cgy. this bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of vad subsequently. in 08/94, the patient developed lower back pain. a workup done in de is not available at the time of this dictation. according to her scanty records, an mri of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in t4 and t8 with

admission the patient developed mid back pain, burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs. he also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities. he stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair. an mri without gadolinium done on 11/20/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from t9 to t12. there was evidence of cord compression. the patient 's decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on ms contin and radiation therapy was being planned

gentamicin but there was a question about the organism 's susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital. he was subsequently switched to imipenem and tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course. the tobramycin and imipenem were started on 11/25/94. in addition, the patient received a five day course of intravenous igg to improve infection control. vancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved mrsa coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity. he was evaluated by the surgery department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time. he is being maintained with twice daily xeroform with betadine changes. these dressing changes are applied by applying the xeroform on betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages. of note, the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes. the plan is to complete a full course of imipenem and tobramycin for his pseudomonas cellulitis. as mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh. the cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression. 2) cardiovascular : the patient was initially treated with dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved. he was noted to be in rapid af on several episodes receiving 5 mg iv lopressor each time with improvement. he has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm. an echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased

hospitalization. the plan is to continue the digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better. 3) oncology : the patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine. he has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay. the plan is to complete a full course of xrt to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma. the patient

continued to suffer from edema of the left upper extremity and a vascular radiology consult revealed a thrombosis of the left subclavian vein extending into the axillary vein. there was some thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein as well. a head ct was performed and was completely negative for any metastatic process involving the brain. thus, a heparin sliding scale was begun. meanwhile, the patient 's eosinophilia was treated with a trial of prednisone. she also developed a mild urinary tract infection which responded to bactrim, but which was subsequently stopped because of diarrhea. the conclusions at this time of the thyroid cytologist, as well as the bone pathologist, were that the findings were diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary metastases.

thromboplastin time 23.3. the electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response and digitalis effect as well as left ventricular hypertrophy. impression on admission : impression was that this was an 83-year-old female with cardiac history, dyspnea on exertion, increased calcium and hyperparathyroidism who presents for parathyroidectomy. hospital course and treatment : on the day of admission, the patient was brought to the operating room for parathyroidectomy. the right superior parathyroid gland was found to be markedly enlarged and consistent with an adenoma. her right superior parathyroid gland was removed and the rest of her parathyroid glands were left in place. postoperatively, the patient did well and was able to cough and phonate completely with no changes from preoperative. the plan was to start her on heparin and coumadin and discontinue her heparin when her coumadin levels became therapeutic as judged by the prothrombin time / inr.

liver function tests within normal limits, and ekg showed a heart rate of 128, axis 73, and possible ectopic p. hospital course : the patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer. there was no evidence of tamponade. an echocardiogram was scheduled and cardiology was consulted. echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox. cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed. she continued to have pulmonary wheezing, unknown origin, without history of asthma. her steroids were tapered and pulmonary was consulted who recommended a ct scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma, induce sputum for cbc, arterial blood gas, continuing of the beta agonist inhalers, and trial of steroid inhalers. they felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious, other cardiovascular causes, or viral bronchiolitis. she had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an fev1 of 36% of predicted and fvc of 56% of predicted. room air arterial blood gas showed a ph of 7.45, po2 of 63, a pco2 of 41, and fairly significant aa gradient. she was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her ct scan on 06/14 and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination. cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10. ekg showed an ectopic low atrial p and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade. she should have a follow-up echocardiogram. echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size, low normal function, moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures, and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient 's cycle without any change in the effusion from 06/11. thoracic surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time. she should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing. she underwent her ct scan. this showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest, question of pulmonary nodules in the chest, pericardial effusion, multiple liver metastases, decreased function of the left kidney, dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter, and periaortic lymphadenopathy. pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time. chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-fu 800 mg per meter squared days 06/18, 06/19, and 06/20. she also received cisplatin 35 per meter squared on 06/19 and ifex and mesna on 06/18. she was noted, on 06/16, to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her

reactive to 2 mm bilaterally. there was no pupillary defect. dolls eye was negative. there was a possible right gaze preference and the patient did not move his eyes. corneals were present bilaterally. gag was present weakly. face was symmetrical. tongue was midline. the patient was moving the right side spontaneously, but could not hold arm or leg up for any length of time. there was only minimal movement on the left side. on sensory testing, the patient withdrew all extremities to pain. reflexes were 2+ and symmetrical all over. the left toe was upgoing, the right toe was downgoing. laboratory : laboratory data revealed a sodium of 139, potassium 3.4, chloride 101, bicarbonate 28, bun 11, creatinine 1.2, glucose 151. ast was 20, alt 12, alkaline phosphatase 80,

moving the right arm and leg spontaneously, though less than before. withdrawal to pain was still present. both plantars were upgoing. a blood gas at this point showed a ph of 7.49, po2 61, pco2 of 33 on 100% non-rebreather mask. ekg showed sinus tachycardia. the patient 's temperature was 102 degrees. a repeat cat scan of the head was performed. this showed continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery infarction now extending into the right cerebellar hemisphere. there was also a high density adjacent to the right cerebellar infarction suggesting the presence of hemorrhage. at this point, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. an mri and mra of the head was arranged to evaluate the extent of his stroke and the posterior circulation. the mri showed infarct of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally, the right occipital lobe, the right thalamus and bilateral pons. the mra of the intracranial circulation demonstrated gross patency of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally and the basilar arteries. the left vertebral artery was not visualized. there was a dominant right vertebral artery. there was mildly reduced flow in the branches of the right middle cerebral artery compared to the left. there was visualization of flow within both posterior cerebral arteries. clinically, the patient continued to deteriorate. neurosurgery was consulted, however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option, since even in the case of cerebellar swelling, there would be no improvement from decompensation. the patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management. heparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage. the aspiration pneumonia was treated with cefotaxime and metronidazole. the patient 's family was involved and they decided to opt for dnr / dni in view of the poor prognosis. the patient passed away at 6:45 am on june 12, 1998. condition on

left clavicular mass. subsequently, the mass continued to increase in size. on 12/23, she was seen by dr. stonge at bri health where a 3 x 7 cm left mid clavicular mass was noted. a fine needle aspirate of this mass reportedly revealed giant cell tumor. the patient was initially told that this was a benign tumor and that it could simply be watched and definitively treated after the delivery of her baby. subsequently, the mass progressively increased in size and the patient had developed significant discomfort in this region. on 1/5, the patient underwent a local tumor debulking at bri health under local anesthesia. the pathology, unfortunately, revealed an aggressive adenocarcinoma ( micropapillary type ; mucin producing) . this prompted further staging work-up. the patient subsequently had a limited chest ct at bri health which showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases, metastases to the sternum, rib, multiple spinal levels ; internal mammary lymphadenopathy. the poor prognosis for the patient and child were discussed and after the patient decided to have an elective abortion, an abdominal ct scan was obtained which revealed diffuse metastatic lesions of the liverspine, ribs and most of the lymph nodes. there was no obvious gior pancreatic tumor identified. the patient had a very firm nodule at the vertex of her calvarium. a specimen was obtained by fine needle aspiration and the pathology of this was consistent with adenocarcinoma. the patient was transferred to nimaconwood valley hospital for management of her cancer and termination of the pregnancy. over the past four weeks, the patient reported progressive shortness of breath and mid thoracic back pain. she has had no motor weakness, abnormal sensation, numbness, tingling or incontinence of bowel or bladder. she denied fevers, chills or sweats. there has been no gi or gu symptoms except for constipation. past medical history : unremarkable. medications : on admission

for invasive monitoring. within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. given hypotension and bradycardia, he was slow to wean from neosynephrine. low dose beta blockade was eventually resumed. chest tubes and pacing wires were removed without complication. on postoperative day three, he transferred to the sdu. he maintained a normal sinus rhythm without atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. he remained in sinus bradycardia ( rate 50-60) and tolerated low dose beta blockade. on pod #6 his creatinine became slightly elevated at 1.4, his lasix was discontinued and the following day his creatinine was stable at 1.4. he continued to progress and was eventually cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day 7. his discharge chest x-ray showed persistent bibasilar atelectasis with only tiny pleural effusions. of note, he will need to remain on plavix for three months postop given the off pump procedure. in addition, he will need to remain

hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities. the patient 's urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion. the patient 's urine output was further augmented by adding dopamine. nevertheless, the patient 's renal failure continued to progress. over the course of the hospitalization his ck fell in the serum. much of his diffuse

ortgold center his serum toxicology screens were positive. this is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure. 7-pneumonia. the patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms. the first was acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus, treated with ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. he subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with vancomycin, dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure. he was seen in consultation by the infectious disease service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily. 8-pancreatitis. the amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161. although not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements. 9-catheter tip infections. the patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension. these were treated with vancomycin. 10-anemia. the patient 's hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization. 11-coma. the patient, although initially minimally responsive, went on to develop a deep comatose state. a ct scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis. the lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient 's persistent coagulopathy. the patient was treated empirically with nafcillin and ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis. further complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy. despite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive. mid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome. the patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization. nevertheless, he developed refractory hypoxemia, hypotension, and ultimately the patient died despite total life support. discharge diagnosis : cocaine intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, septic shock, hepatic failure, pneumonia, pancreatitis, catheter tip infection, anemia, coma. principal procedure : peritoneal dialysis catheter placement, peritoneal dialysis, arterial catheterization, venous catheterization, continuous mechanical ventilation, and parenteral nutrition. complications during admission : neck hematoma secondary to

with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who has had several recent admissions to oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital for respiratory insuffiencey most often secondary to pneumonia. he was most recently discharged from oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital on 03/06/99 and was then transferred to linghs county medical center from which he was discharged on 03/20/99. the patient was doing relatively at home until one day prior to admission he complained discomfort over a suprapubic catheter area. the patient had missed his usual monthly change of his suprapubic catheter and felt discomfort and noticed some blood at the site of the catheter. the patient was brought to the emergency room one day prior to admission where he was evaluated by urology and had his catheter changed. the patient at that time noted slight shortness of breath but was sent home anyway. on the day of admission the patient noticed increasing shortness of breath. the patient was noted to be confused and to be disoriented toward the end of the day after complaining of shortness of breath for most of the day. the patient denies any recent upper respiratory infections, no fevers, no chills, no change in cough, sputum. he also denies any chest pain. no orthopnea. no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. the patient had been taking his usual medications and using his nasal oxygen at home. by the time the patient arrived at the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital emergency room he was in moderate respiratory distress. his initial blood gases on 40% 02 was p02 102, pc02 115, ph 7.11. the patient was given respiratory therapy in the way of nebulizer treatments in the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital emergency room because of a longstanding desire by patient and family to refrain from intubation to be considered do not resuscitate. the patient was not intubated. however he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit where he received continuous respiratory therapy in theway of albuterol nebulizers as well as nasal oxygen, intravenous steroids and intravenous antibiotics. a chest x-ray in the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital emergency room showed new changes on his chest x-ray on top of his usual severe bilateral emphysema with scarring in both lungs. there were new air space opacifications in the left apex and the right lower lobe. these were thought to be consistent either with pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema. past medical history : associated medical problems include : 1. atonic bladder with a suprapubic tube. 2. anxiety. 3. coronary artery disease with a history of

collapsed and complained of substantial weakness. he denied any melana, any hematemesis, nausea or vomiting. he was taken to an outside hospital at the time at which time it was found that his hematocrit was 21, blood pressure 90/60, and his inr was 3.3. of note, he is anti-coagulated for an artificial heart valve. he was at that point given 1 unit of packed red blood cells. on further questioning, the patient reported that he started to feel different several days ago with slowing and difficult ambulation progressing to complete inability to ambulate. he was also short of breath with ambulation, but he does have baseline shortness of breath with exertion. he denied any chest pain, dysuria, loss of consciousness, fevers, chills or any history of myocardial infarction. patient was last admitted to padrugmoff hospital with a hematocrit of 24.5, and was asymptomatic prior to admission. at that time, he had guaiac-positive and had a small bowel follow through which was negative. he was transfused 4 units during that admission and discharged with a hematocrit of 34 on vitamin c and iron sulfate. exam on arrival in the lo hospital emergency room : on arrival at the lo hospital emergency room : he was found to have a temperature of 97.4, heart rate 65, pressure 107/52, respiratory rate 22 and saturating 100% on 2 l of a nasal cannula. general exam at the time was

labs : patient was found to have a troponin of 0.71 on admission with a ck of 46 and ckmb of 3.4. assessment : at that time, it was felt that the patient was likely having a repeat gi bleed and while he was hemodynamically stable, he had evidently lost a substantial amount of blood. hospital course : 1. gi : patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight, the first night after admission and his hematocrit bumped up appropriately. he remained hemodynamically stable throughout his admission. he was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and on iron sulfate and vitamin c. his coumadin was held at the time given the bleeding, even though it was important to keep his inr 2.5-3.5, given his artificial valve it was felt that the risk of continued bleeding was to great to continue the coumadin. he was subsequently seen by the gi team who performed an upper endoscopy which demonstrated the following : in the esophagus, there was a small hiatal hernia and in the stomach there is evidence of erosive gastritis of the body of the stomach and the antrum, the mucous appeared edematous. a small polyp was found in the fundus which stigmata of old bleeding ; an endoclip was applied to this. another polyp was found in the antrum and cold biopsies were obtained there. in the duodenum, a small avm was noted in the second portion of the duodenum and was cauterized. the biopsy subsequently demonstrated a hyperplastic polyp with acute and chronic inflammation and erosion and reactive epithelial changes but no dysplasia. also of note, prior to the upper endoscopy, the patient received fresh frozen plasma to reverse his anticoagulation. patient remained hemodynamically stable during and after the upper endoscopy and his hematocrit remained above 30 following this until the point of discharge. his last recorded hematocrit on discharge was 31.3. his last bun and creatinine were 42 and 1.5 with an inr of 2.5. consideration was given to performing a repeat

a systolic blood pressure greater than 110. in addition, she was slow to awaken after her anesthesia was reversed, and in several attempts to wean from the ventilator, she developed a respiratory acidosis. she therefore remained on the ventilator throughout the day of postoperative day one. on postoperative day two, the patient remained hemodynamically stable. her neo-synephrine drip was weaned to off. she was again weaned from the ventilator, and successfully extubated. her chest tubes were discontinued and, at the end of the day, she was transferred from the cardiothoracic intensive care unit to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation. after being transferred to the floor, the patient did well. over the next several days, her activity level was increased with the assistance of physical therapy and the nursing staff. she remained hemodynamically stable. her respiratory condition remained stable and, on postoperative day four, she was deemed stable and ready to be transferred to rehabilitation for continuing postoperative care and physical therapy. at the time of transfer, the patient 's physical examination is as follows : vital signs :

recent hemorrhage into a cavernous angioma. there was some mild surrounding edema. there are also tiny foci artifact within the cerebellum and base of the pons. there was a larger area of susceptibility artifact in the left temporal lobe, right frontal lobe, and the splenius of the corpus collasum. the brain parenchyma was otherwise normal. there was mild enhancement of the pontine hemorrhagic mass but none elsewhere. there was no areas of restricted diffusion to indicate infarction. mra of the brain was unremarkable. there was no communication >.< in the visualized vessels and the angiomas. follow-up ct was obtained the second day of admission. there was no evidence of developing hydrocephalus, which was a concern due to the surrounding edema, and possible suppression of the fourth ventricle. there was no significant change in size of the subacute pontine hemorrhage. hospital course : mrs. wisniewski is a 45 - year-old woman with a strong family history of cavernous angiomas. she has had several prior bleeding events and presented with a subacute bleed in the mid to lower pons. there was relatively central in location, with only a slight right-sided predominance. her physical examination remained relatively unchanged, with resolution of the subtle left hand weakness and right facial weakness. her gait remained severely ataxic, likely secondary to sensory deafferentation, as well as involvement of crossing pontine cerebellar fibers. therefore, it was recommended that she have aggressive physical therapy at an acute rehabilitation center. the case was discussed with dr. harold from the falmouth hospital. he has followed this family in the past and will see her in follow-up. we will arrange to have a copy of the mri scans sent to him. discharge

10. perforated viscus. 11. abdominal abscesses. 12. sepsis. 13. respiratory failure. history of present illness : the patient was a 53-year-old male with a longstanding history of renal disease with multiple complications and problems related to vascular access and hypercoagulable state. these culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on 12/16/97, which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours. this required a transplant nephrectomy. hospital course and treatment : the patient 's course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias, possibly due to aspiration, and by hemodynamic instability. he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit from the transplant service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension. on transfer, the patient was not sedated, but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator. the patient was found to have substantial auto peep with an elevated dead space. a pulmonary arteriogram on 01/03/98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli, likely less than one week old, possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of 12/19/97. an inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative. the patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately, possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome. the patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation. the physiology at the time of transfer to the medical intensive care unit was consistent with a septic process. ct scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material. for the concern of a perforated viscus, the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on 01/06/98, during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation. the patient remained unstable. he was taken to fluoroscopy, where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum. for this reason, he was taken again to the operating room on 01/08/98, at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction, introduction of five jackson-pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass, cholecystotomy tube, gastrostomy tube, and jejunostomy tube. the patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy. accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation. the patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology. there was no evidence of cardiac tamponade or specific underlying coronary dysfunction. he was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his serratia pneumonia, as well as for his abdominal process. the patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state,

spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics. she has been afebrile for greater than 10 days, including several days on oral antibiotics. the patient 's liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course, to about three times normal, especially the sgot and sgpt. these have spontaneously reversed, and are nearly normal at the time of discharge. a right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones, without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis. the exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear, but we are being careful about administering drugs, which might irritate the liver. the patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization. iron studies are all entirely normal, her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies. the plan is to give her folic acid, but not iron. the patient 's potassiums have been repeatedly low and require

note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist, showed that the patient is aspirating at this time, but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon. it is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for g tube placement are made at this time. she has a history of of angina

diagnosis : ruptured parathyroid adenoma. history of present illness : ms. shuffa is a 73-year-old portuguese speaking woman who was transferred via med flight to verg medical center. she arrived intubated and was hemodynamically stable despite concerns of a dissecting aortic arch aneurysm. she initially presented to brottlake medical center on 9/15/00 complaining of acute onset dysphasia to liquids and solids. while she was in brottlake medical center, she developed new onset stridor, and an ent consult was obtained. they attempted a fiberoptic intubation with a # 6 endotracheal tube and found a 5 mm severely compressed airway. she was also found to have a differential systolic blood pressure and ecchymosis on her anterior chest. given these findings, she underwent a ct scan which showed a retrotracheal mass that appeared to obliterate the esophagus. this raised concerns for a hemorrhage, and she was transferred to verg medical center emergently. at the ingree and ot of weamanshy medical center, she underwent an emergent ct scan with iv contrast. this revealed no extravasation of contrast and no aortic aneurysm. however, it did show an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with a density consistent with a hematoma. she was admitted to the thoracic surgery service under the care of dr. sccrookes. past medical history : severe hypertension, angina, gerd, peptic ulcer disease, status post billroth ii, ovarian cancer, status post tah-bso in 1987 with a negative second look laparotomy in 1988, chronic anemia, chronic left ear infection. medications prior to admission : celexa 10 mg p.o. q.d.; lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; capoten 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; pepcid 20 mg p.o. q.d.; cardizem 180 mg p.o. q.d.; xanax 0.5 mg tabs. on transfer, she was on her preadmission medications plus unasyn and tigan 250 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. allergies : no known drug allergies. social history : she is divorced and retired. she lives with her daughter, and denies any tobacco or alcohol use. physical examination : the patient is intubated. vital signs : temperature 98.6, 66. right arm was 180/80, left 188/72, and a-line was 151/61. tidal volume is 700 with a rate of 10, 10 of pressure support, and 10 of peep, and 100% fio2, satting 100%. general : she was sedated and spontaneously moving all four extremities. neck : edematous. trachea was midline. she had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck. the superior clavicular area showed no signs of central line access attempts. she had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well-circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region. her anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis. lungs : she had bilateral expiratory wheezes. abdomen : soft with good bowel sounds. it was nontender. it was

ekg showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block. ct scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air. it was consistent with a hematoma. hospital course : ms. shuffa underwent an egd and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived. this showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time. she was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator. the differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor. on 9/22/00, she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy. a biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma. the operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus, trachea, aorta, and spine that was full of clot. there was no active bleeding at the time. over the next several days, the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator. she had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma. the ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level. given these findings, she underwent a sestamibi scan. the sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid. at this time, it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma. dr. ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00. she underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma, a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids, resection of a left upper parathyroid, and tracheostomy. she tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the surgical intensive care unit with her new tracheostomy working well. her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left. this required a chest tube. her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count, normal coags, and no obvious source of bleeding. it was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest. however, we are not quite sure why this was occurring. she underwent an extensive workup by hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology. it turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology. in conclusion, by systems : 1. neuro. the patient became intermittently agitated. we have been giving

mass. hospital medical optimization and management following an aborted coronary artery bypass graft when a mobile aortic atheroma was noted. the patient was continued on aspirin, plavix, and statin. once the patient was titrated off dopamine, the beta blocker and ace inhibitor were restarted. with regard to the left ventricular thrombus, her goal inr remained 2.5 to 3 ; and the goal was to start heparin once the patient was stable from a thoracotomy and chest tube standpoint. the patient remained comfortable. by 04-01, on postoperative day two, the patient was doing well and the chest tube was discontinued. the patient still had transcutaneous pacing wires in place. likewise, on 04-01, the patient was weaned off surgery without difficulty. thus, the beta blocker and ace inhibitor were started to be titrated up. in addition, the patient was started on wellbutrin for smoking cessation. at this point, it was determined that the patient would not receive percutaneous coronary intervention on this admission and would likely be discharged to the floor for stabilization with followup. the patient did well and was transferred to the floor on 04-02. after evaluation and a discussion with dr. gunter, it was determined that the patient no longer needed anticoagulation since there was no aortic thrombus but only an aortic plaque, and there was no anterior/apical akinesis noted. at this point, the left ventricular thrombus ( for which she was initially started therapy for) was no longer present. the patient was noted to have a slight hematocrit drop and was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells for a goal hematocrit of greater than 30. by 04-03, captopril and atenolol were started, and the patient 's leg bandage from the vein harvest was removed. the patient continued to do well on the medical regimen and was without chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other symptoms. discharge disposition : thus, the patient was discharged to home. discharge instructions/followup : the patient was to follow up with her primary care physician ( dr. desmet) , as well as with dr. gunter for an eventual percutaneous coronary intervention, and her surgeon ( dr. halcomb) following her thoracotomy. discharge diagnoses: 1. coronary artery disease ; 3-vessel disease. 2. status post aborted coronary artery bypass graft due to mobile aortic atheroma. 3.

white matter consistent with small vessel disease, gliosis or demyelination. a holter monitor was obtained and showed that the patient was in normal sinus rhythm. the heart rate was 53 to 106. there were some very rare atrial premature contractions. there were no ventricular premature contractions. an echocardiogram was obtained and showed that the ejection fraction was 60% and there was no thrombus. it was felt to be within normal limits. over the ensuing days, the patient had several episodes of confusion at night. however, these gradually resolved. she also developed what appeared to

mentation and increased gait instability since one week. on initial exam the patient was not oriented to time, seemed somewhat slow, and had difficulties generating a list of animals. his cranial nerves and strength were full, and the sensory exam showed mildly decreased vibration and proprioception in both le, suggesting peripheral neuropathy. a ct was performed in the deanna that showed a new significant r-frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the same location as the prior bleed. the patient was seen by both neurology and neurosurgery, and the two teams agreed that the etiology seemed to be related to underlying amyloidosis. during the last admission the question of a mass underlying a hemorrhage in the r-frontal region was raised. the location of the hemorrhage was not felt to be typical for hypertensive bleed ( cortical) and it was felt to be unlikely that the recent fall was related to the bleed. the patient could not undergo an mri due to his pacer. he was admitted to the neurology icu for closer monitoring and was stable overnight - bp was initially elevated and required a labetalol drip for < 24 hours, then stabilized. the goal sbp of < 150 was achieved. coags and ua were checked and were normal. for the question of seizure activity associated with a cortical bleed, he was started prophylactically on keppra ( given questionable allergy to dilantin) , at 500 mg bid ; no seizure activity was seen. this medication should be continued as an outpatient at least while the bleed has time to clear up, with planned titration up to 1000 mg bid on 04-05. head ct repeated on 03-30 was unchanged, and the patient remained stable with only very suble focal exam findings ( very mild right pronator drift) as well as his persistently poor memory related to dementia. the plan after 24 hours was to transfer him to the floor, but the hospital was full and he never got a bed. cardiovascularly, lipitor and amiodarone were continued. he could not get an mri due to his pacemaker. there were no telemetry events, and he ruled out by enzyme. pulmonlologically, his chest xray was negative and he complained of no breathing problems. endocrinologically, bg was monitored to improve outcome in icu setting though he had no history of dm. of note, hba1c done 03-04 was slightly elevated ( borderline dm ) at 6.3 ; this was repeated and was still pending on the day of discharge. ins / outs and electrolytes were monitored and were not abnormal ; he was on a bowel regimen, vd boots and pud prophylaxis with protonix during the admission. walking was assessed later and the patient was unstable on his feet. pt was asked to see him for this gait problem. brandon felt well and was seen by pt who suggested a rehab/hahnemann hospital ( worcester) to work on walking with

prostatic biopsy revealed a gleason 's iv, plus v tumor and the ct showed an irregular large prostate with tumor invasion into the bladder and evidence of bilateral retroperitoneal lymph node spread. there was also evidence of bone metastasis at that time. the patient was admitted in october of 1991 for urinary retention and acute renal failure and was treated with fluid rehydration and foley catheter placement. over the past one month prior to admission, the patient 's wife has noticed a marked decrease in p.o. intake and also noted a weight loss of approximately ten pounds in the

insufficiency. there were no clots seen on the echocardiogram. hospital course : the patient was admitted with a right occipital cerebral infarction. the patient was started on intravenous heparin and had the studies as described above for rule out source of embolic strokes including carotid noninvasives, transcranial dopplers, holter electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. the patient also had serial electrocardiogram, which showed no change. the patient also had serial creatinine kinase with mb fractions studied, which revealed mb fraction too low to be tested. the patient also experienced a feeling of moving back and forth when lying down with neck extended during the magnetic resonance imaging study and also in bed. this moving sense, with normal electroencephalogram, was thought to be a mild vestibular dysfunction or from the acute episode of the stroke. the patient will have these symptoms only when the eyes are closed. our opinion was not to intervene or have any further studies for acute period and to continued to observe. the patient did have a hypotensive episode and the systolic blood pressure was 80, after the patient received his regular cardiac medications. the patient had been off his regular medications since during the admission and will be discharged off his medications. otherwise, there were no further episodes of blurred vision. the patient was stable with an unchanged neurological and physical examination and was discharged on aspirin 325 mg po qd, on may 14, 1995. the patient will be randomized on the wars study early next week by the stroke service at ph university of medical center. condition on discharge : the patient was stable with the physical examination as described above. discharge orders : medications - aspirin 325 mg po qd, glipizide 25 mg po qd. the patient will be discharged home without his regular cardiac medications. the patient will be followed by dr. ketyvi liftjesc of the neurology service at ph university of

pulmonary edema. in the setting of inadvertently decreasing lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day mr. state had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea. upon arrival in the emergency room mr. state 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen, morphine, and nitrates and intravenous lasix. chest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the emergency room as noted. the patient denied angina, syncope, preceding worsening orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, chest pain, hematemesis or melena. past medical history : is notable for an inferior myocardial infarction,

the creatine kinase was 114. chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases. the electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction. hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations. after a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent. prior to catheterization a vq scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for pe with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung. subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and d-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent. it was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto. coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries. after a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14, pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute, or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute. based upon these findings it was felt that mr. state most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state. in hospital he was seen by both speech therapy, physical therapy, and the uspend harmemewood medical center congestive heart failure nurse practitioner program. his isordil was increased in hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160. future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures. at a goal weight of 142 pounds, mr. state 's filling

-the pt has a small area of reversible ischemia on recent mibi, and has troponins persistently elevated in the setting of his renal disease. his troponins remained lower than his baseline levels and there was no suspicion of acs causing syncope. he continued on his zocor, cozaar and labetalol. we will now hold his coumadin given his recent falls and bleeding risk. his aspirin was restarted prior to discharge. 4. endo - tsh was 4.7 and normal. 5. heme : the patient has a macrocytosis. his b12 level was 418 and normal. he does have a history of b12 deficiency in the past, and evidence for peripheral neuropathy ble which may also be contributing to his recent falls. ? etoh 6. psych : watch for etoh wd. the patient had no signs of alcohol withdrawal. his serum toxicology screen was negative. 7. pulm : copd and r pleural effusion, off oxygen and stable. 8. gu : r complex renal cyst, bladder diverticula. the patient will need a follow up ultrasound to further evaluate these incidental findings seen on imaging upon admission. 9. id : the patient 's urinalysis was normal. he had no fecal leukocytes. a c.difficile test is negative on prelim read, however very low suspicion given no recent antibiotic use. additional comments : please return to the hospital if you have falls, headache, visual changes, muscle weakness, chest pain, shortness of breath. discharge condition : stable to do / plan : 1) hemodialysis 2) please do not take coumadin. 3) please follow up with pcp to have ultrasound of right kidney and bladder to assess right kidney cyst and bladder diverticula seen incidentally 4) please follow up with dr. clow to follow up results of abdominal fat pad biopsy and blood tests to assess for amyloid. no dictated summary entered by : felsapprydefusc, eri n,
